What’s the difference between this one and this one?”  Or, “Here’s the problem I’m trying to solve, and here’s my code so far Can you help me with my code (either troubleshoot this error I’m getting or show me whether this is the best way to approach the problem)” I took advantage of making the most out of AI by asking it to explain functions it used that I wasn’t familiar with I also always tried to understand AI logic by walking myself through each line, one by one  The next two categories that I used AI for mostly in this course was *Brainstorming research questions with NEON metagenomic data* *‘Vibe code’: generating statistical, network, or other advanced analyses* kind of follows or falls under this This is especially helpful because I don’t have a research background and while I can ask simple questions like “What phyla are enriched in these soil pH ranges?”, I still would need to expand on this question My problem is that I’m not creative (maybe not curious enough?) with my questions This is why using AI to jumpstart brainstorming is especially helpful, especially because it can quickly provide background information that might spark my curiosity","For me, examples would be when the code simply doesn’t work Sometimes it’s due to base R issues or packages and version incompatibility—things like that I don’t know any technical terms to describe what the issues are more specifically I also don’t have a good understanding of how computers work  One specific example is when I wanted to do an analysis of MAG data using a heat map based on soil moisture My input was, “Here’s my code so far where I got the average soil temperature for each phyla How do I make a heat map from here?”  AI gave me a solution where I had to convert my data frame to a matrix first The code didn’t work from there due to some issues with creating the matrix I believe I could have troubleshooted some more, as well as learn more about matrices on my own, but in that moment I really just wanted a quick visual and wasn’t willing to spend time to learn about matrices I think the only issue with AI feedback here is that my code is nuanced to the data I’m working with and AI doesn’t get to have the full picture I admit I could have been less lazy here and try troubleshooting it myself!",Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Neutral,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Agree,Much lower,3+ hrs,Strongly agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Strongly agree,Sometimes,"Ran and tested the code in R, Asked follow-up questions to the AI","Hallucinated functions or packages, Incorrect R syntax or arguments, Overcomplicated solutions",Disagree,Neutral,Neutral,Agree,Agree,Strongly agree,Neutral,Strongly agree,Slightly less engaged,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Agree,Disagree,Neutral,Neutral,Very clear,"Debugging with AI, Verifying AI output, Advanced analyses","
I feel like *Debugging with AI* is the most common issue I experience when using AI for code because what we are working on can be so nuanced Because of the nuance, I’m not sure how feasible in-class support with AI debugging would be (in the context of a whole class period), especially if everyone is working on different analyses / project? I would say the same thing for *Verifying AI output* I think AI is a useful tool used for assistance, but I also found that what we did in the course has been very valuable— namely doing the chapter outlines They can take quite a while to get through, but I agree that it’s important for us to know the basics of R ourselves

For Advanced analyses, maybe it would be helpful to have a brief overview in class of things like alpha-diversity and beta-diversity I learned about this before in other classes (and don’t remember what they are), so maybe formally going over it in class, if only briefly, would be good Maybe taking an additional lecture to explain more of what MAGs are and why they’re useful in research, since I didn’t get it the first time Eventually I came to understand what they are Also, personally I don’t know anything about analyzing data, so if we received some advice about things to pay attention to (for example, make sure you take a larger sample size Or any research principles we aren’t aware of? And what is ANOVA test, if we happened to need to use it) from class, just briefly, that would help As for using AI to help generate code for Advanced analyses, it helped so much

Perhaps one thing I think would be good for this course is to require or at least highly encourage students to explain what their code chunk does, and put that explanation in the Quarto document above the code chunk Or to put comments in code in cases where the code looks suspiciously flawless We sometimes do these things by putting the header “AI note” and “Code chunk”, but I wonder whether it would be good for students to go further than minimally stating what prompt they asked AI Either way, I suppose a student’s ability to gain some useful knowledge is up to how disciplined they are able to be when they have powerful resources like AI",10,10,"Using AI is extremely helpful in a coding class especially for students like me without much familiarity with code I wish more coding classes were offered more frequently in the Biology Department R programming is such a useful skill, even if I’m a beginner, and I will certainly be using it to make visuals in the future I even saw my classmate from here using R to make graphs for project in a different course

Since this is a research-based course and we have limited time this semester (the semester is very short, only 3-4 months), I loved that we gain hands-on, first-hand experience of working with real MAG data and doing analyses with it Doing the chapter outlines from the textbook was very helpful in providing us with foundational knowledge about code syntax and using dplyr and ggplot for visualization and analysis I like learning foundational principles of coding from a concrete source like a textbook, compared to self-teaching myself through google At the same time, I still think having resources like internet and AI are such a big help because they introduce me to so much I would’t have explored (like other functions, more example uses, graph aesthetics, research ideas) And I’m sure that self-teaching is still an important part of learning to code and research, too (though I don’t like thinking of the idea so much)

I found that AI saved so much time when it came to problem-solving, troubleshooting errors, and me memorizing functions That can be a pain when working on coding assignments, which I’ve experienced before I think it’s important to responsibly use AI as a tool to help with my understanding, but not just use it to get the assignment done That’s why I don’t just use AI to ask for code suggestions, but also for explanation for every function use I also take a look at how the code was structured to understand the problem-solving logic I think that goes back to how we emphasized vibe coding— you should be able to know how to approach the problem, even if you can’t write the code just yet

I have one comment about why students asked less questions to the instructor about the actual code itself and problem-solving (although maybe there were still questions about debugging?) I am sure the reason is obviously having the assistance of AI, which is a big help with coding But I think the underlying reason could be that most students hope to avoid asking a question and then being told to look into it themselves and check their resources they already have I hear instructors say this so often, even in my other research-based class I’m taking this semester Personally, this is a main reason I refrain from asking questions, because given enough time and (sometimes hard) effort on my own, I can answer my own question I just have to look for the answers myself on google or AI Most of the questions I want to ask are ones that I could answer given time and effort on my own I feel like instructors may think I am lazy if I don’t try to first figure it out Also, another reason is that students are confused and want to ask questions, but don’t know what exactly to ask or how to phrase it I’ve heard a classmate say this in another course, and I feel the same way sometimes It’s harder when there are technical terms involved because I don’t know how to describe what I’m confused about Overall, I personally don’t find either of these things to be huge issues in this course, as you were always willing to help us and were a very encouraging instructor I never felt pressured in a negative way Given our resources, it made sense for me to try to at least try to problem solve myself, which often resulted in me figuring out an answer…thanks to my resources, like AI!

Overall, I’m not sure what changes I would suggest for this course, especially given our short semester The important thing was that I learned useful programming skills that I know I will apply in the future Thank you Dr Blanchard!"

Even if it was an intelligent person, I would check their words and answers if I suspected it sounded too good to be true (that's probably because by nature, I also have a tendency to say things with a lot of confidence even if they are not true—simply because I believe them) 
If someone came to me with the total confidence that there are three types of T cells, I would know better and tell them ""that's not true"" If they told me ""a new type of IgG was discovered in a paper by Matt et al,"" I'd have a tendency to say ""yes? Can you show me?"" If I was told ""Did you know there are over 300 types of turtles?"" I may have a small doubt, but usually say ""oh nice!"" and accept it as a doubtful, but actual fact (and mess up and repeat it with total confidence to other people as a truth) 
Asking any question to AI comes with the understanding that it is only a computer and just does math But even if it could think and was human, wouldn't we also double-check their statement and thoughts? Or correct them, or ask for proofs? "
