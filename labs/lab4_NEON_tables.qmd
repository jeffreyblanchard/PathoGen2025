## Learning Objectives


## Our Project Space

NEON has produced metagenomic data as data product since 2014. The Joint Genome Institute has recently annotated version all reads prior to 20222 [Gs0144570](https://gold.jgi.doe.gov/study?id=Gs0144570). However, these metagenomes have a low sequencing depth and therefore are difficult to use for assembling bacterial genomes.

Last year JGI and NEON collaborated to produce metagenomes which are ~10-fold deeper which allow for better assemble of reads into gene length and greater fragments.  We will work with the [NEON 2023 data Gs0166454](https://gold.jgi.doe.gov/study?id=Gs0166454) study sets. By choosing `Select Columns for Table` we can download metadata associated with each metagenome.
