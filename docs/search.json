Through collaborations with the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) and the National Microbime Collaborative Network (NMDC), most of the metagenomic sequencing data are available on the data portals of these organizations. Connections to these external data sources are being built into NEON data releases.

This includes legacy data as well as all samples that are part of the JGI CSP award, which covers deep sequencing and analysis by JGI of all NEON metagenome samples collected in 2023 and 2024. Included in the table are several fields with JGI metadata and statistics for each sample, such as Sequencing Method, GenomeSize, GeneCount, and number of bins (metaBATbinCount). Also included are some NEON variables such as siteID and collectDate, as well as multiple environmental terms assigned to each sample according to ENVO specifications (e.g. Ecosystem Category, Ecosystem Type, Specific Ecosystem). The table also has reference codes for the Genome Online Database (GOLD), including GOLD Analysis Project ID and GOLD Study ID; and the taxon OID (imgGenomeID) that allows accessing the sample on the

The Quabbin Reservoir is the primary water supply for Boston, 40 towns in the Greater Boston area and several surrounding towns. There is a rich history of the river valley. The name Quabbin, meaning meeting of many waters, is after Native American chief Nani-Quaben. Artifacts show that people (ancestors of the Nipmucs) were living in the Swift River Valley as far back as 12,000 years - Ref. Here is a timeline of events including the removal of the towns of Dana, Prescott, Enfield and Greenwich. Today the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) manages the forests surrounding the watershed which provide a living green bio-filter. The watershed “catches the rain, stores it, and releases it slowly, soaking up nutrients, keeping erosion to a minimum, and yielding a consistent supply of clean water.”\n\n\n\nNEON Harvard Forest and Quabbin sites\n\n\nHere are some of the NEON data portals we may work with\n\nNEON Soils\nNEON Soil Microbes\nNEON Aquatic Microbes\nNEON Pathogens\nNEON Biorepository\n\n\n\n\nOur metagenomic data comes from a collaboration between NEON and the Joint Genome Institute at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and supported by the US Department of Energy.

However, these metagenomes have a low sequencing depth and therefore are difficult to use for assembling bacterial genomes.\nLast year JGI and NEON collaborated to produce metagenomes which are ~10-fold deeper which allow for better assemble of reads into gene length and greater fragments. We will work with the NEON 2023 Gs0166454 study set. Although some of the data for 2024 is available, JGI is still processing the data and producing annotations (see above illustration)."

    "text": "What is bioinformatics?\nWhat is reproducible research?\nWhy learn bioinformatics and data science skills?\nHigh Performance Computing (Unity)\nOverview of the R statistical programming language\n\n\n\n\nIn recent years, the field of genomic analysis and bioinformatics has sifted towards requiring some knowledge of R, Python/Perl/C and the use of high performance computers (often requiring some fundamental Unix skills) available at national computing centers for working with large data sets. While there are many great software packages available for particular computational problems in evolutionary biology, many software programs do not have a user interface (e.g. drop down menus and such) and are run in command line mode. The lab sessions in this course have been designed to give students an introduction to working with R and packages used for genome and metagenome analyses. We are using recently release National Ecological Observatory Network data to design a course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE). The first 4 weeks we will discuss to project space, discuss research ideas and formulate testable hypothesis or discovery driven approaches, design the experimental approaches. For a preview today I will give an overview of the project space.\n\n\n\nBioinformatics is the field of science in which biology, computer science, statistics and information technology merge into a single discipline. There are three important sub-disciplines within bioinformatics:\n\nThe development of new algorithms and statistics with which to assess relationships among members of large data sets.\nThe development and implementation of tools that enable efficient access and management of different types of information.\nThe analysis and interpretation of various types of data including nucleotide and amino acid sequences, protein domains, and protein structures.\n\n\n\n\nis a term coined in response to the high demand of techniques and resources for handling the explosion of molecular data.\nis a buzzword to describe a growing field.\nbenefits from the physicists, chemists and mathematicians crossing over into biology.\nis a collection of tools.\nis way of thinking about a problem!\n\n\n\n\nIn order to make new algorithms and data sources available to biologists someone needs to write applications that include these algorithms and create new databases. Often this is first done by academic research groups. Later redone by private companies when market is large and profitable enough. There is a large gap between what is done by research groups and companies. Sometimes this is filled by large government funded projects, but not usually in time for most researchers. This is why bioinformatics and programming skills have become very valuable.\n\n\n\n\nThe field of data science has grown tremendously over the last decade and the two programming languages, R and Python, used in analyzing genomic data are the most popular languages for data science. This made it easy to transfer bioinformatics skills to diverse fields.\nHere a few links that I will go over in lab:\n\nWhat is Data Science? \n\nWhat is Data Science? 8 Skills That Will Get You Hired\n\nOpen Science is Kinder Science\n\nData Carpentry\n\nBuilding a local community of practice in scientific programming for life scientists\n\n\n\n\nR is the largest and most comprehensive public domain statistical computing environment. The core R package is enhanced by several hundred user-supplied add-on packages, including many for gene expression analysis, in the  Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). Omegahat Project for Statistical Computing.  BioConductor is an open source and open development software project for the analysis and comprehension of genomic data and is based primarily on the R programming language. R and Bioconductor are free, Open Source and available for Windows, MacOS and a wide variety of UNIX platforms.\n\n\nReproducibility is the hallmark of science, which is based on empirical observations coupled with explanatory models. While reproducibility encompasses the full science lifecycle, and includes issues such as methodological consistency and treatment of bias, in this course we will focus on computational reproducibility: the ability to document data, analyses, and models sufficiently for other researchers to be able to understand and ideally re-execute the computations that lead to scientific results and conclusions. With current publishing practices, this can be difficult because data are typically unavailable, the method sections of papers do not detail the computational approaches used, and analyses and models are often conducted in graphical programs, or, when scripted analyses are employed, the code is not available. In this course we will learn how to write code that is integrated into reproducible reports.\n\n\n\nMany introductory and advance tutorials have been developed for R. Here are a few\n\nThe offical R manuals\nCRAN’s Introduction to R\nR for Data Science by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham\nR Graphics Cookbook by Winston Chang\nData Carpentries Genomic Workshop Sessions\nData Analysis and Visualization in R for Ecologists\n\nThere are also many workshops and online R courses that you could take to follow up what you learn in this class.\n\n\n\n\nGitHub has become a popular way to manage, share and view code for open source projects. The tutorials created for this course will be written in Quarto and posted on GitHub. Thus, you will be able to continue to see course materials after the end of the semester. You will use and make a GitHub web site for your research project.\n\n\n\nYou all are part of the first generation of generative AI users. The saying goes “AI won’t take your job, but someone using who knows how to use AI might.” Think of AI as a force multiplier. You have to learn to code and clearly state your problems before AI can to help you. This class will fully use generative AI in hopes that it will challenge us to think more creatively about problems and not stress out about syntax. Think first…ask questions…code…solve problem! We will use the UMass version of Microsoft Copilot Chat and Copilot integrated into RStudio. We will embrace “Vibe coding” (see What is Vibe Coding, Exactly?) and ride the waves.\n\n\n\nIn this course we will learn to write basic unix commands, run bioinformatics software from the command line and allocate computer resources for submitting large jobs. UMass has modern High Performance Computing system, Unity, and excellent staff members to help get you going and trouble shoot issues. Working on HPCs has become much easier with the advent of web interfaces that look and work much like software running on your computer.\n\n\n\nYou can do all of the R-based labs on your own computer. Follow these directions by the makers of RStudio, Posit. You will need to download the lab files from Unity or the course GitHub site."

    "text": "On the Computer\n\nGetting started on Unity\nUnity https://unity.rc.umass.edu/ is the UMass High Performance Computing cluster. We will be running bioinformatics software and using R and RStudio from the Unity HPC.\n\n\nWorking in RStudio\nThe default R studio appearance includes 4 windows.\n\nThe R script(s) and data view (upper left window).\nConsole (bottom left window).\nWorkspace and history (upper right window).\nFiles, plots, packages and help (botton right window).\n\n\n\n\nRStudio Screenshot\n\n\n\nThe R script(s) and data view window (upper left window)\nIn this window you can type directly into a file, run code and save the file for reuse. In this class we will work with Quarto files (discussed below).\n\n\nConsole Window (bottom left window)\nThe console is where you can type R commands and see output.\nType\n3 + 3\nTo better document and save your code write it in the Quarto documents rather than the console. On occasion we will use the console to access documentation and for other purposes.\n\n\nEnvironment and History tabs (upper right window)\nThe Environment tab shows all the active objects. If you have a data frame loaded, then click on the object will enable you to view the table. The History tab shows a list of commands used so far.\n\n\nFiles, Plots, Packages and Help (bottom right window)\nThere are data sets that come with the R package and used in tutorials. If you run the following command you will see a graph of related to the cars data set in the Plots window\n\n\n\nQuarto\nThe Quarto is a scientific publishing system. In this class we will use one of it’s simplest features, producing a report with the code and resulting output (graphs, tables, statistical analysis). Quarto can also be used to produce slides, web sites, scientific manuscripts and books. For example, and all the labs for this course and my research laboratory website were made using Quarto. Quarto wraps together many previous packages used for publishing with R.\nTo use Quarto with R, the rmarkdown R package is installed. There are some differences between a Quarto and R Markdown document, but overall they are very similar.\n\nProducing Lab Reports with Quarto\nIn RStudio select File &gt; New File &gt; Quarto Document. Add a title (e.g. Lab 1) and your name then create the document. Notice the your file says untitled with an asterisk. Save your file (e.g. lab1). This will automatically add the .qmd extension to your file (lab1.qmd). ALWAYS SAVE YOUR FILE BEFORE YOU START WORKING AND OFTEN WHILE WORKING.\nThe top section of the document delineated by the --- is called the YAML block. In this template it contains your the title, your name, the output type (html) and the editor preference (visual).You can also work with your file directly with the source code by clicking the source icon.\nThe following lines of code in your YAML block with generate a table of contents (toc) as shown at the top of this lab. The line with embed-resources creates a stand alone html file.\n---\ntitle: \"Lab 1\"\nauthor: \"Jeff Blanchard\"\nformat:\n  html:\n    toc: true\n    toc_float: true\n    embed-resources: true\neditor: visual\n---\nThe text with the white background is in rmarkdown. The icons in the same section as the visual icon you can easily made the text in bold or in italics, change the text from normal to a header, create bulleted or numbered lists, insert html links, add images, insert tables and more.\nThe text with the gray background is in R code chunks. Click on the green play icon in the top right corner of the code chunk to run the code.\nClick on the Render icon. This will run the code, show the output and create a html file that is automatically saved to your directory (look for the lab1.html file) and will automatically open this file in your browser.\nCreate new code chunk by clicking on the green +C icon to the right of the Render icon. In the code chunk type plot(cars). Then click the run the code to see a graph of the cars data set that comes preloaded into R.\n\n\nR code\nplot(cars)"

    "text": "Writing R code\n\nAssignment statements\nAll R statements where you create objects are called assignment statements and the form “object_name &lt;- value”\n\n\nR code\nx &lt;- 3\n\n\nSimply typing x will give the value of x\n\n\nR code\nx\n\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nYou will make lots of assignments and &lt;- is a pain to type. Instead, use RStudio’s keyboard shortcut: Alt + - (the minus sign). Notice that RStudio automagically surrounds &lt;- with spaces, which is a good code formatting practice. An equals sign = will work in place of &lt;-, but it will cause confusion later so keep to the convention of using &lt;- to make assignments\n\n\nObject Names\nObject names must start with a letter, and can only contain letters, numbers, underscores and periods. You want your object names to be descriptive, so you’ll need a convention for multiple words. I recommend snake_case where you separate lowercase words with an underscore. Note that R is case sensitive, e.g., object names gene, GENE, Gene are all different.\n\n\nR code\ngenome_size &lt;- 3100000000\n\n\nImportant note: since there are many built-in functions in R, make sure that the new object names you assign are not already used by the system. A simple way of checking this is to type in the name you want to use. If the system returns an error message telling you that such object is not found, it is safe to use the name.\n\n\nCharacters\nA character object is used to represent string values in R. It is defined by double quotes ““.\n\n\nR code\nDNA &lt;- \"ATGAAA\"\nDNA\n\n\n[1] \"ATGAAA\"\n\n\n\n\nVectors\nA vector is a sequence of data elements of the same basic type. data elements in a vector are officially called components. Assignment operator (&lt;-) stores the value (object) on the right side of (&lt;-) expression in the left side. Once assigned, the object can be used just as an ordinary component of the computation. The c function concanenates the components into a vector.\n\n\nR code\nrandom_numbers &lt;- c(1,10,100)    \nrandom_numbers\n\n\n[1]   1  10 100\n\n\nNow you can do scalar computations on a vector\n\n\nR code\nrandom_numbers * 2\n\n\n[1]   2  20 200\n\n\nor use sum, sort, min, max, length and many other operations. For example\n\n\nR code\nsort(random_numbers)\n\n\n[1]   1  10 100\n\n\nYou can also do vector arithmatic\n\n\nR code\nrandom_numbers &lt;- c(1,10,100) \ny&lt;- c(1,2,3) \nrandom_numbers * y\n\n\n[1]   1  20 300\n\n\nVectors can also be made of characters\n\n\nR code\ncodons&lt;- c(\"AUG\", \"UAU\", \"UGA\") \ncodons\n\n\n[1] \"AUG\" \"UAU\" \"UGA\""

With current publishing practices, this can be difficult because data are typically unavailable, the method sections of papers do not detail the computational approaches used, and analyses and models are often conducted in graphical programs, or, when scripted analyses are employed, the code is not available. In this course we will learn how to write code that is integrated into reproducible reports.\n\n\n\nMany introductory and advance tutorials have been developed for R. Here are a few\n\nThe offical R manuals\nCRAN’s Introduction to R\nR for Data Science by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham\nR Graphics Cookbook by Winston Chang\nData Carpentries Genomic Workshop Sessions\nData Analysis and Visualization in R for Ecologists\n\nThere are also many workshops and online R courses that you could take to follow up what you learn in this class."

    "text": "Bioinformatics is the field of science in which biology, computer science, statistics and information technology merge into a single discipline. There are three important sub-disciplines within bioinformatics:\n\nThe development of new algorithms and statistics with which to assess relationships among members of large data sets.\nThe development and implementation of tools that enable efficient access and management of different types of information.\nThe analysis and interpretation of various types of data including nucleotide and amino acid sequences, protein domains, and protein structures.\n\n\n\n\nis a term coined in response to the high demand of techniques and resources for handling the explosion of molecular data.\nis a buzzword to describe a growing field.\nbenefits from the physicists, chemists and mathematicians crossing over into biology.\nis a collection of tools.\nis way of thinking about a problem!\n\n\n\n\nIn order to make new algorithms and data sources available to biologists someone needs to write applications that include these algorithms and create new databases. Often this is first done by academic research groups. Later redone by private companies when market is large and profitable enough. There is a large gap between what is done by research groups and companies. Sometimes this is filled by large government funded projects, but not usually in time for most researchers. This is why bioinformatics and programming skills have become very valuable."

In this class we will use one of it’s simplest features, producing a report with the code and resulting output (graphs, tables, statistical analysis). Quarto can also be used to produce slides, web sites, scientific manuscripts and books. For example, and all the labs for this course and my research laboratory website were made using Quarto. Quarto wraps together many previous packages used for publishing with R.\nTo use Quarto with R, the rmarkdown R package is installed. There are some differences between a Quarto and R Markdown document, but overall they are very similar.\n\nProducing Lab Reports with Quarto\nIn RStudio select File &gt; New File &gt; Quarto Document. Add a title (e.g. Lab 1) and your name then create the document. Notice the your file says untitled with an asterisk. Save your file (e.g. lab1). This will automatically add the .qmd extension to your file (lab1.qmd). ALWAYS SAVE YOUR FILE BEFORE YOU START WORKING AND OFTEN WHILE WORKING.\nThe top section of the document delineated by the --- is called the YAML block. In this template it contains your the title, your name, the output type (html) and the editor preference (visual).You can also work with your file directly with the source code by clicking the source icon.\nThe following lines of code in your YAML block with generate a table of contents (toc) as shown at the top of this lab. The line with embed-resources creates a stand alone html file. This is also availabe as lab_template.qmd in our course directory /work/pi_bio678_umass_edu\n---\ntitle: \"Lab 1\"\nauthor: \"Your name\"\nformat:\n  html:\n    toc: true\n    toc_float: true\n    embed-resources: true\neditor: visual\nexecute: \n  warning: false\n  message: false\n---\nThe text with the white background is in rmarkdown. The icons in the same section as the visual icon you can easily made the text in bold or in italics, change the text from normal to a header, create bulleted or numbered lists, insert html links, add images, insert tables and more.\nThe text with the gray background is in R code chunks. Click on the green play icon in the top right corner of the code chunk to run the code.\nClick on the Render icon. This will run the code, show the output and create a html file that is automatically saved to your directory (look for the lab1.html file) and will automatically open this file in your browser.\nCreate new code chunk by clicking on the green +C icon to the right of the Render icon. In the code chunk type plot(cars). Then click the run the code to see a graph of the cars data set that comes preloaded into R.\n\n\nR code\nplot(cars)"

Instead, use RStudio’s keyboard shortcut: Alt + - (the minus sign). Notice that RStudio automagically surrounds &lt;- with spaces, which is a good code formatting practice. An equals sign = will work in place of &lt;-, but it will cause confusion later so keep to the convention of using &lt;- to make assignments\n\n\nObject Names\nObject names must start with a letter, and can only contain letters, numbers, underscores and periods. You want your object names to be descriptive, so you’ll need a convention for multiple words. I recommend snake_case where you separate lowercase words with an underscore. Note that R is case sensitive, e.g., object names gene, GENE, Gene are all different.\n\n\nR code\ngenome_size &lt;- 3100000000\n\n\nImportant note: since there are many built-in functions in R, make sure that the new object names you assign are not already used by the system. A simple way of checking this is to type in the name you want to use. If the system returns an error message telling you that such object is not found, it is safe to use the name.\n\n\nCharacters\nA character object is used to represent string values in R. It is defined by double quotes ““.\n\n\nR code\nDNA &lt;- \"ATGAAA\"\nDNA\n\n\n[1] \"ATGAAA\"\n\n\n\n\nVectors\nA vector is a sequence of data elements of the same basic type. data elements in a vector are officially called components. Assignment operator (&lt;-) stores the value (object) on the right side of (&lt;-) expression in the left side. Once assigned, the object can be used just as an ordinary component of the computation. The c function concanenates the components into a vector.\n\n\nR code\nrandom_numbers &lt;- c(1,10,100)    \nrandom_numbers\n\n\n[1]   1  10 100\n\n\nNow you can do scalar computations on a vector\n\n\nR code\nrandom_numbers * 2\n\n\n[1]   2  20 200\n\n\nor use sum, sort, min, max, length and many other operations.

    "text": "Quarto\nDifferences between R Markdown and Quarto\nYAML blocks\nCode blocks\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarto is the name of an open-source publishing system used for technical and scientific writing.\nIt lets you combine text, code, and outputs in one document—perfect for data science, research, and reproducible reports.\nYou can write in Python, R, Julia, or Observable JavaScript, and publish to formats like HTML, PDF, Word, and even full websites\nIt’s considered the next generation of R Markdown, and works with tools like Jupyter Notebooks, VS Code, and RStudio.\nBecause it is based on R Markdown, there is a wealth of related resources and books published on and using R Markdown. See some of on the examples books using R we will periodically using in the course.\n\n\n\n\nR Markdown and Quarto are both tools for creating dynamic documents that combine code, text, and outputs (like plots or tables), but they differ in terms of design philosophy, features, and flexibility. Here’s a breakdown of their key differences:\n\n\n\nR Markdown:\n\nDeveloped by RStudio.\nPrimarily designed for R users.\nBuilt on top of knitr and Pandoc.\nDeeply integrated into the RStudio IDE.\n\nQuarto:\n\nAlso developed by RStudio, but as a next-generation tool.\nLanguage-agnostic: supports R, Python, Julia, and Observable JavaScript.\nUses Pandoc directly (not knitr).\nDesigned to unify and modernize the workflow across languages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR Markdown: Best suited for R. Python support is possible but less seamless.\nQuarto: First-class support for multiple languages in a single document. You can mix R, Python, Julia, and JavaScript.\n\n\n\n\n\nR Markdown:\n\nUses YAML front matter for metadata.\nCode chunks are written using triple backticks with language identifiers.\n\nQuarto:\n\nSimilar structure but more consistent and extensible YAML.\nSupports Markdown extensions like callouts, citations, cross-referencing, and more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR Markdown:\n\nSupports HTML, PDF, Word, slides (via xaringan or ioslides), etc.\nCustomization can be complex for advanced layouts.\n\nQuarto:\n\nSupports all R Markdown formats plus:\n\nReveal.js slides.\nBooks and websites with built-in navigation and styling.\nJupyter-style notebooks.\n\nEasier to configure and customize outputs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR Markdown:\n\nExecutes code using knitr (for R) or reticulate (for Python).\nLess control over execution environment.\n\nQuarto:\n\nUses Jupyter kernels or R directly.\nBetter support for notebook-style interactivity and execution control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR Markdown:\n\nNo native concept of a “project” beyond RStudio projects.\n\nQuarto:\n\nSupports Quarto Projects: collections of documents with shared configuration.\nIdeal for books, blogs, websites, and multi-document workflows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarto:\n\nMore modern and extensible.\nSupports Lua filters, Markdown extensions, cross-referencing, citations, and interactive widgets.\nBetter support for version control and CI/CD workflows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nR Markdown\nQuarto\n\n\n\n\nLanguage Support\nPrimarily R\nR, Python, Julia, JS\n\n\nExecution Engine\nknitr\nJupyter / native\n\n\nOutput Formats\nMany\nMore + easier config\n\n\nInteractivity\nLimited\nRich (widgets, JS)\n\n\nProject Support\nBasic\nFull project system\n\n\nExtensibility\nModerate\nHigh\n\n\nIdeal For\nR-centric reports\nMulti-language docs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s go the the Quarto documentation for Markdown basics and more details on Figures\nIt is important to specific where the figure is located relative to your .qmd file. The path can be relative (giant_virus.jpg) or (images/giant_virus.jpg) or absolute (/home/pi_jlb_umass_edu/images/giant_virus.jpg).\n\n\n\ngiant virus\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Quarto, a YAML block is a section at the top of a document that contains metadata and configuration settings. YAML stands for “YAML Ain’t Markup Language”, and it’s used to define things like the document title, author, output format, and more.\n\n\nA YAML block is enclosed by triple dashes (---) at the beginning and end:\n---\ntitle: \"My Analysis Report\"\nauthor: \"Jeffrey Blanchard\"\ndate: \"2025-09-08\"\nformat: html\neditor: visual\n---\nThis block tells Quarto: - The title of the document. - The author name. - The date to display. - The output format (e.g., HTML, PDF, Word). - The editor preference (e.g., visual or source).\n\n\n\nHere are some frequently used fields:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ntitle\nTitle of the document\n\n\nauthor\nAuthor name(s)\n\n\ndate\nDate of publication\n\n\nformat\nOutput format (e.g., html, pdf, docx, revealjs)\n\n\ntoc\nTable of contents (true or false)\n\n\nnumber-sections\nNumber section headings\n\n\ntheme\nVisual theme for HTML or slides\n\n\ncode-fold\nWhether code chunks can be collapsed\n\n\nexecute\nControls code execution (e.g., echo, eval, freeze)\n\n\nbibliography\nPath to .bib file for citations\n\n\nfilters\nLua filters for advanced customization\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\ntitle: \"Data Exploration\"\nauthor: \"Jeffrey Blanchard\"\nformat:\n  html:\n    toc: true\n    code-fold: true\n    theme: cosmo\n    embed-resources: true\nexecute:\n  echo: true\n  freeze: auto\n---\nThis configures: - An HTML output with a table of contents. - Collapsible code chunks. - A Bootstrap theme (cosmo). - Code execution settings.\nImportant for our class is the embed-resources: true line. This creates a single html file with the figures embeded in the file. If this line is not in the YAML block a new directory will be created which contains the images and is linked to the html file.

    "text": "Introduction to R Graphics\nR provides comprehensive graphics utilities for visualizing and exploring scientific data. To date we have been making a few plots using the R Base Graphics. In addition, several more recent graphics environments extend these utilities. These include the grid, lattice and ggplot2 packages. All have the roles, but ggplot2 environment that is part of the Tidyverse package has become popular and is now used for many R packages and in scientific publications.\n\nggplot2 and the Grammar of Graphics\nggplot2 is meant to be an implementation of the Grammar of Graphics, hence the gg in ggplot. The basic notion is that there is a grammar to the composition of graphical components in statistical graphics. By directly controlling that grammar, you can generate a large set of carefully constructed graphics from a relatively small set of operations. As Hadley Wickham (2010), the author of ggplot2 said,\n“A good grammar will allow us to gain insight into the composition of complicated graphics, and reveal unexpected connections between seemingly different graphics.”\n\n\nTutorials and resources\nYou can make amazing graphs with ggplot, but there is a long learning curve so we will have multiple lab sessions on ggplot and graphing. Here are a few different resources for ggplot.\n\nHadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund released the second edition of R for Data Science.\nData Carpentry’s Data Analysis and Visualization in R for Ecologists\nFor those with a visual learning style there is Maria Nattestad’s Youtube videos\nThe ggplot cheatsheet"

Today and next week for simplicity we will work with data sets that come with R and the are available as R packages.\n\nData sets (data frames) that come with R\nR contains pre-loaded data sets that will see in many examples posted on the internet. The mtcars and iris data sets are very popular. You can see the whole list by typing data(). This will pop up a window with a list of the data sets. Include #| eval: false within your R code chunk if you want to show but not run code. You can also use the older R Markdown style of including it in the header ```{r eval = FALSE}\n\n\nR code\ndata()\n\n\nIn class we will talk more about the structure of a data set, which can be summarized using the str command\n\n\nR code\nglimpse(iris)\n\n\nRows: 150\nColumns: 5\n$ Sepal.Length &lt;dbl&gt; 5.1, 4.9, 4.7, 4.6, 5.0, 5.4, 4.6, 5.0, 4.4, 4.9, 5.4, 4.…\n$ Sepal.Width  &lt;dbl&gt; 3.5, 3.0, 3.2, 3.1, 3.6, 3.9, 3.4, 3.4, 2.9, 3.1, 3.7, 3.…\n$ Petal.Length &lt;dbl&gt; 1.4, 1.4, 1.3, 1.5, 1.4, 1.7, 1.4, 1.5, 1.4, 1.5, 1.5, 1.…\n$ Petal.Width  &lt;dbl&gt; 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.2, 0.1, 0.2, 0.…\n$ Species      &lt;fct&gt; setosa, setosa, setosa, setosa, setosa, setosa, setosa, s…\n\n\nYou can see the whole data set by typing the name iris or by typing view(iris) which will pop up a window with the data set. However we don’t want to show all 150 observations (rows) of the iris data set in this document. We can use the head command to show just the first 5 rows.\n\n\nR code\nhead(iris)\n\n\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species\n1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa\n2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa\n3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa\n4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa\n5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa\n6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa\n\n\n\n\nData sets that are part of R packages\nR for Data Science uses the palmerpenguins package, “which includes the penguins dataset containing body measurements for penguins on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, and the ggthemes package, which offers a colorblind safe color palette. We will load these for our work today.” You likely will need to install these packages before loading the libraries.\n\n\nR code\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\nlibrary(ggthemes)\n\n\nData Analysis and Visualization in R for Ecologists uses the ratdat package, a long-term dataset from Portal, Arizona, in the Chihuahuan desert.\n\n\nR code\nlibrary(ratdat)\n\n\nThe help command can be used to learn more about the palmerpenguins and ratdat packages. After running the below commands, in the right bottom corner under the Help tab the package documentation can be viewed.

After running the code flights is unchanged. This is good in many situations working with large data because we don’t want to be creating new variables that use up more computer memory and it is easier to keep track of fewer variables. If we wish to save the end results, we can assign this to a new variable (e.g. IAH_arr_delay_by_month)\n\n\nR code\nIAH_arr_delay_by_month &lt;- flights |&gt;\n  filter(dest == \"IAH\") |&gt; \n  group_by(year, month) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    arr_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\n\nNotice that nothing prints out. The new table is put in the data object IAH_arr_delay_by_month. Now you could use this object repeatedly in your code without running the larger code chunk above each time. You can view IAH_arr_delay_by_month by using view(IAH_arr_delay_by_month) or clicking on the object in the Environment window.\n\n\nWriting pseudo code\nWas there a flight on every month of 2013?\nBefore writing any code it is best to break this down into the tasks we need to accomplish\n\nfilter flight data set to the year 2013\nshow only 1 row for each month\ndisplay table to see if each month is present or count to see if rows equal 12\n\nThis is actually the hard part of solving a coding challenge. Writing the codes is relatively easy when you know the steps. This is the greatest challenge in using Generative AI to assist you in coding.\n\n\nR code\nflights |&gt; \n  filter(year == 2013) |&gt; \n  distinct(month)\n\n\n# A tibble: 12 × 1\n   month\n   &lt;int&gt;\n 1     1\n 2    10\n 3    11\n 4    12\n 5     2\n 6     3\n 7     4\n 8     5\n 9     6\n10     7\n11     8\n12     9"

If we wish to save the end results, we can assign this to a new variable (e.g. IAH_arr_delay_by_month)\n\n\nR code\nIAH_arr_delay_by_month &lt;- flights |&gt;\n  filter(dest == \"IAH\") |&gt; \n  group_by(year, month) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    arr_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\n\nNotice that nothing prints out. The new table is put in the data object IAH_arr_delay_by_month. Now you could use this object repeatedly in your code without running the larger code chunk above each time. You can view IAH_arr_delay_by_month by using view(IAH_arr_delay_by_month) or clicking on the object in the Environment window.\n\n\nWriting pseudo code\nWas there a flight on every month of 2013?\nBefore writing any code it is best to break this down into the tasks we need to accomplish\n\nfilter flight data set to the year 2013\nshow only 1 row for each month\ndisplay table to see if each month is present or count to see if rows equal 12\n\nThis is actually the hard part of solving a coding challenge. Writing the codes is relatively easy when you know the steps. This is the greatest challenge in using Generative AI to assist you in coding.\n\n\nR code\nflights |&gt; \n  filter(year == 2013) |&gt; \n  distinct(month)\n\n\n# A tibble: 12 × 1\n   month\n   &lt;int&gt;\n 1     1\n 2    10\n 3    11\n 4    12\n 5     2\n 6     3\n 7     4\n 8     5\n 9     6\n10     7\n11     8\n12     9"

We will work with the NEON 2023 data Gs0166454 study sets. By choosing Select Columns for Table we can download metadata associated with each metagenome."

However, these metagenomes have a low sequencing depth and therefore are difficult to use for assembling bacterial genomes.\nLast year JGI and NEON collaborated to produce metagenomes which are ~10-fold deeper which allow for better assemble of reads into gene length and greater fragments. We will work with the NEON 2023 and 2024 data Gs0166454 study sets."

The path can be relative (giant_virus.jpg) or (images/giant_virus.jpg) or absolute (/home/pi_jlb_umass_edu/images/giant_virus.jpg).\n\n\n\ngiant virus\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Quarto, a YAML block is a section at the top of a document that contains metadata and configuration settings. YAML stands for “YAML Ain’t Markup Language”, and it’s used to define things like the document title, author, output format, and more.\n\n\nA YAML block is enclosed by triple dashes (---) at the beginning and end:\n---\ntitle: \"My Analysis Report\"\nauthor: \"Jeffrey Blanchard\"\ndate: \"2025-09-08\"\nformat: html\neditor: visual\n---\nThis block tells Quarto: - The title of the document. - The author name. - The date to display. - The output format (e.g., HTML, PDF, Word). - The editor preference (e.g., visual or source).\n\n\n\nHere are some frequently used fields:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ntitle\nTitle of the document\n\n\nauthor\nAuthor name(s)\n\n\ndate\nDate of publication\n\n\nformat\nOutput format (e.g., html, pdf, docx, revealjs)\n\n\ntoc\nTable of contents (true or false)\n\n\nnumber-sections\nNumber section headings\n\n\ntheme\nVisual theme for HTML or slides\n\n\ncode-fold\nWhether code chunks can be collapsed\n\n\nexecute\nControls code execution (e.g., echo, eval, freeze)\n\n\nbibliography\nPath to .bib file for citations\n\n\nfilters\nLua filters for advanced customization\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\ntitle: \"Data Exploration\"\nauthor: \"Jeffrey Blanchard\"\nformat:\n  html:\n    toc: true\n    code-fold: true\n    theme: cosmo\n    embed-resources: true\nexecute:\n  echo: true\n  freeze: auto\n---\nThis configures: - An HTML output with a table of contents. - Collapsible code chunks. - A Bootstrap theme (cosmo). - Code execution settings.\nImportant for our class is the embed-resources: true line. This creates a single html file with the figures embeded in the file. If this line is not in the YAML block a new directory will be created which contains the images and is linked to the html file. This means that if you turn in this html file (without using embed-resources: true) the images will not be shown.\n\n\n\nQuarto YAML is: - More consistent and extensible. - Supports nested configuration (e.g., format.html.toc). - Easier to manage across multi-format outputs (e.g., HTML and PDF from one source).\nIn Quarto, R code chunks are sections of code embedded in your document that get executed when the document is rendered. These chunks are enclosed in triple backticks and start with {r}. You can customize their behavior using chunk options, which control things like whether the code is shown, whether it’s executed, how results are displayed, and more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR code\nsummary(cars)\n\n\n     speed           dist       \n Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  \n 1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  \n Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  \n Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  \n 3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  \n Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00  \n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s a categorized list of the most useful options:\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\nDescription\n\n\n\n\neval\nWhether to evaluate the code (TRUE or FALSE)\n\n\necho\nShow the code in the output (TRUE or FALSE)\n\n\ninclude\nInclude both code and output (TRUE or FALSE)\n\n\nerror\nShow errors in output (TRUE or FALSE)\n\n\nwarning\nShow warnings (TRUE or FALSE)\n\n\nmessage\nShow messages (TRUE or FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nresults\nHow to display results (\"markup\", \"asis\", \"hide\")\n\n\nfig.width\nWidth of plots (in inches)\n\n\nfig.height\nHeight of plots (in inches)\n\n\nfig.cap\nCaption for figures\n\n\nfig.align\nAlignment of figures (\"left\", \"center\", \"right\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ncache\nCache results to avoid re-running code\n\n\nfreeze\nFreeze output to avoid re-execution unless explicitly updated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ntidy\nAutomatically tidy code before execution\n\n\ncollapse\nCollapse code and output together\n\n\ncomment\nPrefix for output lines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{r pressure-plot, fig.width=6, fig.height=4, fig.cap=\"Pressure vs Temperature\"}\n\n\nR code\nplot(pressure)\n\n\n\n\n\nPressure vs Temperature\n\n\n\n\nThis chunk: - Hides the code (echo=FALSE) - Sets figure size - Adds a caption - Names the chunk (pressure-plot) for reference\n\n\n\n\nTry a different Quarto theme\n\n\n\nCreate a lab report that has\n\nA link out to an external web site.\nAn image embedded.\nA table of contents using the YAML block\nThe code folded using the YAML block\nA code chunk with plot(cars) in which the plot is sized to a figure width of 3 and height of 2\nA code chunk in which the output, but not the code is in the rendered file.\nTry a different Quarto theme.\n\n\n\n\nThis lab was created with assistance from UMass Copilot"

You can mix R, Python, Julia, and JavaScript.\n\n\n\n\n\nR Markdown:\n\nUses YAML front matter for metadata.\nCode chunks are written using triple backticks with language identifiers.\n\nQuarto:\n\nSimilar structure but more consistent and extensible YAML.\nSupports Markdown extensions like callouts, citations, cross-referencing, and more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR Markdown:\n\nSupports HTML, PDF, Word, slides (via xaringan or ioslides), etc.\nCustomization can be complex for advanced layouts.\n\nQuarto:\n\nSupports all R Markdown formats plus:\n\nReveal.js slides.\nBooks and websites with built-in navigation and styling.\nJupyter-style notebooks.\n\nEasier to configure and customize outputs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR Markdown:\n\nExecutes code using knitr (for R) or reticulate (for Python).\nLess control over execution environment.\n\nQuarto:\n\nUses Jupyter kernels or R directly.\nBetter support for notebook-style interactivity and execution control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR Markdown:\n\nNo native concept of a “project” beyond RStudio projects.\n\nQuarto:\n\nSupports Quarto Projects: collections of documents with shared configuration.\nIdeal for books, blogs, websites, and multi-document workflows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarto:\n\nMore modern and extensible.\nSupports Lua filters, Markdown extensions, cross-referencing, citations, and interactive widgets.\nBetter support for version control and CI/CD workflows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nR Markdown\nQuarto\n\n\n\n\nLanguage Support\nPrimarily R\nR, Python, Julia, JS\n\n\nExecution Engine\nknitr\nJupyter / native\n\n\nOutput Formats\nMany\nMore + easier config\n\n\nInteractivity\nLimited\nRich (widgets, JS)\n\n\nProject Support\nBasic\nFull project system\n\n\nExtensibility\nModerate\nHigh\n\n\nIdeal For\nR-centric reports\nMulti-language docs"

    "text": "In Quarto, a YAML block is a section at the top of a document that contains metadata and configuration settings. YAML stands for “YAML Ain’t Markup Language”, and it’s used to define things like the document title, author, output format, and more.\n\n\nA YAML block is enclosed by triple dashes (---) at the beginning and end:\n---\ntitle: \"My Analysis Report\"\nauthor: \"Jeffrey Blanchard\"\ndate: \"2025-09-08\"\nformat: html\neditor: visual\n---\nThis block tells Quarto: - The title of the document. - The author name. - The date to display. - The output format (e.g., HTML, PDF, Word). - The editor preference (e.g., visual or source).\n\n\n\nHere are some frequently used fields:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ntitle\nTitle of the document\n\n\nauthor\nAuthor name(s)\n\n\ndate\nDate of publication\n\n\nformat\nOutput format (e.g., html, pdf, docx, revealjs)\n\n\ntoc\nTable of contents (true or false)\n\n\nnumber-sections\nNumber section headings\n\n\ntheme\nVisual theme for HTML or slides\n\n\ncode-fold\nWhether code chunks can be collapsed\n\n\nexecute\nControls code execution (e.g., echo, eval, freeze)\n\n\nbibliography\nPath to .bib file for citations\n\n\nfilters\nLua filters for advanced customization\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\ntitle: \"Data Exploration\"\nauthor: \"Jeffrey Blanchard\"\nformat:\n  html:\n    toc: true\n    code-fold: true\n    theme: cosmo\n    embed-resources: true\nexecute:\n  echo: true\n  freeze: auto\n---\nThis configures: - An HTML output with a table of contents. - Collapsible code chunks. - A Bootstrap theme (cosmo). - Code execution settings.\nImportant for our class is the embed-resources: true line. This creates a single html file with the figures embeded in the file. If this line is not in the YAML block a new directory will be created which contains the images and is linked to the html file. This means that if you turn in this html file (without using embed-resources: true) the images will not be shown.\n\n\n\nQuarto YAML is: - More consistent and extensible. - Supports nested configuration (e.g., format.html.toc). - Easier to manage across multi-format outputs (e.g., HTML and PDF from one source).\nIn Quarto, R code chunks are sections of code embedded in your document that get executed when the document is rendered. These chunks are enclosed in triple backticks and start with {r}. You can customize their behavior using chunk options, which control things like whether the code is shown, whether it’s executed, how results are displayed, and more."

There directory paths that are listed in examples will often be different than the ones you need to use on Unity.\n\nAbsolute vs. Relative Paths\nAbsolute Path: Starts from the root directory (/) and specifies the full path to a file or directory.\nExample: /home/jlb/images/star_virus.png\nRelative Path: Starts from the current working directory.\nExample: images/star_virus.png (if you’re already in /home/jlb)\nTo find your absolute path in RStudiio. Type in the console (bottow left window) getwd()\n&gt; getwd()\n[1] \"/home/jlb_umass_edu\"\nOften I will put the data sets we are working with in our course directory which has the path\n/work/pi_bio678_umass_edu/data_NEON/\ntherefore to load the data into RStudio\nNEON_MAGs &lt;- read_tsv(\"/work/pi_bio678_umass_edu/data_NEON/exported_img_bins_Gs0166454_NEON.tsv\")\nI suggest you make a new folder for today’s lab in names images in your home directory. When you create or plot a graph you can use the relative path\n\"images/iris_example_plot1.pdf\"\nor the absolute path\n\"home/jlb/images/iris_example_plot1.pdf\"\n\n\n\nControlling graph size in Markdown\nThe dimensions of an individual graph in the Markdown document be adjusted by specifying the graph dimensions in the header for the r code chunk.\n#| fig-height: 20\n#| fig-width: 8\nThis is similar to what we used in previous labs where we wanted to show but not run the code\n#| eval: false\nIf you want to run the code but not show the code\n#| echo: false\n\n\nGraphic Output\nYou may have realized that you can export plots in R Studio by clicking on Export in the Plots window that appears after you make a graph. You can save as a pdf, svg, tiff, png, bmp, jpeg and eps. You can also write the output directly to a file. This is particularly useful for controling the final dimensions in a reproducible way and for manuscripts.\n\nCookbook for R - Output to a file - PDF, PNG, TIFF, SVG \n\n\n\nR code\n# Plot graph to a pdf outputfile\npdf(\"../images/iris_example_plot1.pdf\", width=6, height=3)\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  labs(title = \"Iris Sepal Length vs Wide\", x = \"Sepal Length\", y = \"Sepal Width\") \ndev.off()\n\n\npng \n  2 \n\n\n\n\nR code\n# Plot graph to a png outputfile\nppi &lt;- 300\npng(\"../images/iris_example_plot2.png\", width=6*ppi, height=4*ppi, res=ppi)\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species)) + \n  geom_point()\ndev.off()\n\n\npng \n  2 \n\n\nFor more details on sizing output Cookbook for R - Output to a file - PDF, PNG, TIFF, SVG \n\n\nMarkdown loading images\nSometimes it is useful in controlling the image layout for a report to file with the graph and then subsequently load it into the .qmd file. This works with png files, but not pdfs. You can also upload images made with other bioinformatic tools into your report.\n![Iris example plot](../images/iris_example_plot2.png) \n\n\n\nIris example plot\n\n\nAnother way to present a graph without the code is adding echo = FALSE within the r{} chunk - {r echo = FALSE}. This prevents code, but not the results from appearing in the knitr file.\n\n\nInteractive graphs\nWith plotly/ggplotly (https://plot.ly/ggplot2/) you can make interactive graphs in your lab report.\n\n\nR code\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n\n\n\nR code\n# Version 1\nggplotly(\n  ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species)) + \n    geom_point()\n )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR code\n# Version 2\np &lt;- ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species)) + \n  geom_point()\nggplotly(p)"

The disease caused by the virus is coronavirus disease (COVID-19). In this lab we will work with reporting data on COVID-19 cases, deaths and recoveries.\n\nIntroduction to JHU case tracking data\nResearchers (Ensheng Dong, Hongru Du, Lauren Gardner) at John Hopkins University developed an interactive dashboard to visual data and track reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) in real time. The underlying data is collated from the following sources was updated several times a day until March 2023 (For more recent views of the data see the (CDC tracker and NY Times Tracker)\nIt is important to understand that this data is only as accurate as the reporting and many cases of the disease go unreported because of a lack of testing. This some countries may have have confirmed cases because of more comprehensive testing. Thus, the reporting data represent a minimum number of cases.\nJHU researchers make data that goes into the dashboard available on Github repo for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Cases. In this lab we will work with this data.\nLet’s take a look at the files and the structure of data in the files.\n\ncsse_covid_19_data\n\ncsse_covid_19_daily_reports\n\n03-11-2020.csv\n\n\n\nOpen up the file to look at the structure\nThe file contains the columns\nProvince/State Country/Region Last Update Confirmed Deaths Recovered Latitude Longitude\nIt is important to note that for some countries there is only one row, while for others (e.g. China and US) there are multiple rows representing different provinces or states. Thus, we will need to sum these rows to get a total count for the US and China when we make graphs. From experience in making this tutorial I know the Column names with / will cause errors in ggplot ()."

    "text": "Animated Graphs with gganimate\nAnimated graphs when down right have a great visual impact. You can do this in R and have your animations embedded on your web page. Essentially gganimate creates a series of files that are encompassed in a gif file. In addition to having this gif as part of your report file, you can save the gif and use in a slide or other presentations. It just takes a few lines of code to covert and existing ggplot graph into an animation. See Tutorial for Getting Started with gganimate and gganimate: How to Create Plots with Beautiful Animation in R.\nThis are some important gganimate functions:\n\ntransition_*() defines how the data should be spread out and how it relates to itself across time.\nview_*() defines how the positional scales should change along the animation.\nshadow_*() defines how data from other points in time should be presented in the given point in time.\nenter_()/exit_() defines how new data should appear and how old data should disappear during the course of the animation.\nease_aes() defines how different aesthetics should be eased during transitions.\n\n\nInstalling gganimate and gifski\ngifski is a package for creating a gif file from gganimate.

    "text": "Background\n\nReproducible Research\nReproducibility is the hallmark of science, which is based on empirical observations coupled with explanatory models. While reproducibility encompasses the full science lifecycle, and includes issues such as methodological consistency and treatment of bias, in this course we will focus on computational reproducibility: the ability to document data, analyses, and models sufficiently for other researchers to be able to understand and ideally re-execute the computations that led to scientific results and conclusions.\n\n\nWhat is needed for computational reproducibility?\nThe first step towards addressing these issues is to be able to evaluate the data, analyses, and models on which conclusions are drawn. Under current practice, this can be difficult because data are typically unavailable, the method sections of papers do not detail the computational approaches used, and analyses and models are often conducted in graphical programs, or, when scripted analyses are employed,the code is not available.\nAnd yet, this is easily remedied. Researchers can achieve computational reproducibility through open science approaches, including straightforward steps for archiving data and code openly along with the scientific workflows describing the provenance of scientific results (e.g., @hampton_tao_2015, @munafo_manifesto_2017).\n\n\nConceptualizing workflows\nScientific workflows encapsulate all of the steps from data acquisition, cleaning, transformation, integration, analysis, and visualization.\n\nWorkflows can range in detail from simple flowcharts to fully executable scripts. R scripts and python scripts are a textual form of a workflow, and when researchers publish specific versions of the scripts and data used in an analysis, it becomes far easier to repeat their computations and understand the provenance of their conclusions.\n\n\nThe problem with filenames\nEvery file in the scientific process changes. Manuscripts are edited. Figures get revised. Code gets fixed when problems are discovered. Data files get combined together, then errors are fixed, and then they are split and combined again. In the course of a single analysis, one can expect thousands of changes to files. And yet, all we use to track this are simplistic filenames. You might think there is a better way, and you’d be right: version control.\nVersion control systems help you track all of the changes to your files, without the spaghetti mess that ensues from simple file renaming. In version control systems like git, the system tracks not just the name of the file, but also its contents, so that when contents change, it can tell you which pieces went where. It tracks which version of a file a new version came from. So its easy to draw a graph showing all of the versions of a file, like this one:\n\nVersion control systems assign an identifier to every version of every file, and track their relationships. They also allow branches in those versions, and merging those branches back into the main line of work. They also support having multiple copies on multiple computers for backup, and for collaboration. And finally, they let you tag particular versions, such that it is easy to return to a set of files exactly as they were when you tagged them. For example, the exact versions of data, code, and narrative that were used when a manuscript was originallysubmitted might be eco-ms-1 in the graph above, and then when it was revised and resubmitted, it was done with tag eco-ms-2. A different paper was started and submitted with tag dens-ms-1, showing that you can be working on multiple manuscripts with closely related but not identical sets of code and data being used for each, and keep track of it all.\n\n\nVersion control and Collaboration using Git and GitHub\nFirst, just what are git and GitHub?\n\ngit: version control software used to track files in a folder (a repository)\n\ngit creates the versioned history of a repository\n\nGitHub: web site that allows users to store their git repositories and share them with others\n\n\n\nThe Git lifecycle\nAs a git user, you’ll need to understand the basic concepts associated with versioned sets of changes, and how they are stored and moved across repositories. Any given git repository can be cloned so that it exist both locally, and remotely. But each of these cloned repositories is simply a copy of all of the files and change history for those files, stored in git’s particular format. For our purposes, we can consider a git repository just a folder with a bunch of additional version-related metadata.\nIn a local git-enabled folder, the folder contains a workspace containing the current version of all files in the repository. These working files are linked to a hidden folder containing the ‘Local repository’, which contains all of the other changes made to the files, along with the version metadata.\nSo, when working with files using git, you can use git commands to indicate specifically which changes to the local working files should be staged for versioning (using the git add command), and when to record those changes as a version in the local repository (using the command git commit).\nThe remaining concepts are involved in synchronizing the changes in your local repository with changes in a remote repository. The git push command is used to send local changes up to a remote repository (possibly on GitHub), and the git pull command is used to fetch changes from a remote repository and merge them into the local repository.\n\n\ngit clone: to copy a whole remote repository to local\ngit add (stage): notify git to track particular changes\ngit commit: store those changes as a version\ngit pull: merge changes from a remote repository to our local repository\ngit push: copy changes from our local repository to a remote repository\ngit status: determine the state of all files in the local repository\ngit log: print the history of changes in a repository\n\nThose seven commands are the majority of what you need to successfully use git. But this is all super abstract, so let’s explore with some real examples."

    "section": "Sequence Alignment Background",
    "text": "Sequence Alignment Background\nSequence Alignment is one of the most fundamental operations of bioinformatics. Sequence alignments are used to decide if genes or proteins are related functionally, structurally and evolutionarily. It is also at the core of sequence search methods such as BLAST.\nThere are three principal methods of pair-wise sequence alignment\n\nDot matrix analysis.\nThe dynamic programming (or DP) algorithm.\nWord or k-tuple methods (such as those used in BLAST and FASTA - which we will discuss later)\n\n\nDot matrix analysis\nThis method involves constructing a matrix with one of the sequences to be compared running horizontally across the bottom, and the other running vertically along the left-hand side. Each entry of the matrix is a measure of similarity of those two residues on the horizontal and vertical sequence. The simplest scoring system, distinguishes only between identical (dots) and non-identical (blank) residues.\nThe dot plot displays graphically any possible sequence alignments as diagonals on the matrix. Insertions, deletions, direct repeats and inverted repeats can be visually detected on a dot plot. Dot plot can also detect regions of RNA that are self-complementary and thus might form secondary structure.\n\nRef:\nThis dot plot represents an alignment of two different strains of Helicobacter pylori. Forward matches are shown in red, while reverse matches are shown in green. This alignment clearly shows a major inversion event centered around the origin of replication.UM\n\n\nThe dynamic programming algorithm\n“Dynamic programming was formalized by mathematician Richard Bellman, who was working at RNAD corporation on optimal decision processes. He wanted to concoct an impressive name that would shield his work from US Secretary of Defense Charles Wilson, a man know to be hostile to mathematics research. His work involved times series and planning - thus ‘dynamic’ and ‘programming’ (note, nothing particularly to do with computer programming). Bellman especially liked ‘dynamic’ because”it’s impossible to use the work dynamic in the pejorative sense”; he figured dynamic programming was “something not even a Congressman could object to” (Bellman 1984).” (Eddy 2004)\nThe dynamic programming algorithm is at the heart of many bioinformatics programs including BLAST (sequence searching), FASTA (sequence searching), CLUSTALW (multiple sequence alignmnet), HMMER (profile searching), GENSCAN (gene finding), MFOLD (RNA folding), and PHYLIP (phylogenetic analysis). Dynamic programing was first used for global alignment of protein sequences by Needleman and Wunnsch (1970) and to find local alignments by Smith and Waterson (1981).\n  MLIGKVIGSVVSTRKN-LNVGKFMIVEPLK\n  |     |  |  ||   || ||||     |        Global Alignment\n  MVAARLI-VWANTRKTSLNLGKFMLAEIIK\n  \n              TRKN-LNVGKFM\n              ||   || ||||               Local Alignment\n              TRKTDLNLGKFML\n\n\n\nSubsitution penalties differ for particular nucleotides or aminoacids\nAmino acids are put together into proteins based on their three nucleotide codons, and most mutational events usually only change one nucleotide at time. For example, starting with the Alanine codon GCU and looking at all possible changes on a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code#RNA_codon_table\nGCU -&gt; UCU = Alanine (A) -&gt; Serine (S)\nGCU -&gt; ACU = Alanine (A) -&gt; Threonine (T)\nGCU -&gt; CCU = Alanine (A) -&gt; Proline (P)\nGCU -&gt; GUU = Alanine (A) -&gt; Valine (V)\nGCU -&gt; GAU = Alanine (A) -&gt; Aspartic Acid (D)\nGCU -&gt; GGU = Alanine (A) -&gt; Glycine (G)\nGCU -&gt; GCA = Alanine (A) -&gt; Alanine (A)\nGCU -&gt; GCC = Alanine (A) -&gt; Alanine (A)\nGCU -&gt; GCG = Alanine (A) -&gt; Alanine (A)\nThus, from the Alanine codon GCU with a single substitution we can only get to 6 of the 19 other amino acids and 33% of the changes are going to result in keeping Alanine at the site in the protein, the other six amino acids would result 11% of the time. Even if we look at all codons for Alanine, there are still 12 amino acids that can not be made by single substitution. Thus, the frequency of changing Alanine to another amino acid by a single nucleotide change would be\n       A   R   N   D   C   Q   E   G   H   I   L   K   M   F   P   S   T   W   Y   V\n    A .33  0   0  .06  0   0  .06 .11  0   0   0   0   0   0  .11 .11 .11  0   0  .11\n\n\n\nOrigin of protein substitution matrices and bioinformatics\nProtein substitution matrices were first developed by Margaret Dayhoff, one of the founders of the field of bioinformatics. She was particularly interested in the possibility of deducing the evolutionary relationships of organisms from protein sequences. Toward these ends she collected all the known protein sequences and, as a service to the scientific community, made them available to others in 1965 in a small book, the first Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure.\nRef: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Oakley_Dayhoff\nFrom these sequences, she and her coworkers developed a model of protein evolution which resulted in the development of a set of widely used substitution matrices. These are frequently called Dayhoff or PAM (Percent Accepted Mutation) matrices and similar matrices are used in many areas of bioinformatics including: sequence similarity searches (e.g. BLAST), multiple sequence alignment tools (e.g ClustalW), phylogenetics and identifying functional regions of proteins.\n\n\nNatural selection governs which amino acid changes are observed\nJust like mutation mucks with the frequency matrix so does Natural Selection. Changes that occur between amino acids that have different biochemical properties are likely to affect the function of the protein. Therefore, a substitution is more likely to occur between amino acids with similar biochemical properties. In the above example with the Alanine codon a substitution that yields an amino acid change would result in mostly changes to other neutral amino acids, whereas the frequency of change to Aspartic Acid would probably be much lower. Amazingly, the genetic code has evolved to minimize changes between amino acids with different biochemical properties.\nAmino Acid          Side chain polarity Side chain acidity or basicity\n Alanine              nonpolar            neutral\n Arginine             polar                  strongly basic\n Asparagine           polar                  neutral\n Aspartic acid        polar                  acidic\n Cysteine             polar                  neutral\n Glutamic acid        polar                  acidic\n Glutamine            polar                  neutral\n Glycine              nonpolar               neutral\n Histidine            polar                  weakly basic\n Isoleucine           nonpolar               neutral\n Leucine              nonpolar               neutral\n Lysine               polar                  basic\n Methionine           nonpolar               neutral\n Phenylalanine        nonpolar               neutral\n Proline              nonpolar               neutral\n Serine               polar                  neutral\n Threonine            polar                  neutral\n Tryptophan           nonpolar               neutral\n Tyrosine             polar                  neutral\n Valine               nonpolar               neutral\n\n\n\nAccounting for multiple substitutions\nAs time goes on and sequence divergence gets larger it gets harder to account for multiple substitutions at the same amino acid position. PAM protein matrices are based on global alignments of closely related proteins. However, sequence changes over long evolutionary time scales are not well approximated by compounding small changes that occur over short time scales. For comparing more distantly related sequence other types of matrices are used. One of the most common is the The BLOSUM (BLOck SUbstitution Matrix) series of matrices created by Steve Henikoff and colleagues. Both the PAM and BLOSUM are not expressed as transformation frequencies but the probabilities of transformation are expressed by log-odds scores as shown below for a BLOSUM62 matrix.\n\nRef: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_matrix"

However, if the sequenes are of various lengths, problem is more complex, potentially very complex:\n    RGSALKAVEAPNDPNHEA......YKPIQELLDAMDN.....YIPDPQRDVDKPFL\n    RGSALKALEGDAAYIEKVR..........ELMQAVDD.....NIPTPEREIDKPFL\n    RGSALKALE.....IEKVR..........ELMQAGDAAYVDDNIPTPEREIDKPFL\n    RGSALLALEEMHKNPKTKRGENEWVDKIWELLDAIDE.....YIPTPVRDVDKPFL\n    RGSALLALEQMHRNPKTRRGENEWVDKIWELLDAIDE.....YIPTPVRDVDKPFL\n    KGSALQALEALQANPKTARGEDKWVDRIWELLDAVDS.....YIPTPERATDKTFL\n    RGTARNALESPSKDIN....APEY.KCILELMNAVDE.....YIPTPQRAVDQPFL\n    KGSALQALE....NAE....DEEKTKCIWELLQAMDD.....YIPAPERDIDKPFL\n    KGSAFGAMS....NPE....DPESTKCVKELLESMDN.....YFDLPERDIDKPFL\n    RGSAFAAMS....KPD....DPAATKCLDELLDTMDK.....YFVIPERALDKPFL\nIn many cases the best position to place an indel is ambiguous. Ideally, one would know the phylogeny for the sequences; this would help infer the sequence of indels. Unfortunately one normally needs a multiple sequence alignment to make inferences about how the sequences are related. Most alignment algorithms make a quick approximation of phylogeny, and then base alignments on these. Sound circular? You are right and this is a challenging problem that is at the forefront of research in phylogenetics…the joint estimation of the alignment and phylogeny. For this class we will stick to the traditional method of first aligning sequences followed by phylogenetic analysis.\nProgressive alignment methods are efficient enough to implement on a large scale for many (100s to 1000s) sequences. Progressive alignment services are commonly available on publicly accessible web servers so users need not locally install the applications of interest. The most popular progressive alignment method has been the Clustal family Different portals or implementations can vary in user interface and make different parameters accessible to the user. Clustal Omega is used extensively for phylogenetic tree construction.\nThe basic steps in Clustal are:\n\nCalculate all possible pairwise alignments, record the score for each pair\nCalculate a guide tree based on the pairwise distances (algorithm: Neighbor Joining)\nFind the two most closely related sequences\nAlign these sequences (algorithm: Smith-Waterman).\n\nCalculate a consensus of this alignment\nReplace the two sequences with the consensus\nFind the two next-most closely related sequences (one of these could be a previously determined consensus sequence).\nIterate until all sequences have been aligned\n\nExpand the consensus sequences with the (gapped) original sequences\nReport the multiple sequence alignment\n\n\nSoftware for sequence alignment\nThere are many tools available for sequence alignment. The common tools are hosting at the European Bioinformatics Institute.\n\nPairwise sequence alignment\nMultiple sequence alignment\n\nThe most commonly used are Clustal, Muscle and MAFFT. MAFFT is commonly implemented for working with large data sets and where speed is important (e.g. web servers)"

His discovery was dependent on using phylogenetic methods to determine the relationship of his microbial sequence to other sequences in the database. Since his discovery, progress sequencing specfic genes from genomic DNA has greatly simplified the process of understanding microbial phylogenies. In this project you will be given a DNA sequence, then construct a multiple sequence alignment and do a phylogenetic analysis to show the relationships among the taxa represented by the DNA sequences.\nFrom a practical perspective, phylogenetic analysis is broken up into methods related to tree building and tree visualization. I have assembled a core group DNA sequences of small subunit ribosomal gene from our national DNA database Genbank to provide an example Tree_of_Life_Core_Sequences.txt. The files contains data for the following species.\n\nThermoplasma volcanium\nHalalkalicoccus jeotgali\nCandidatus Korarchaeum cryptofilum\nNanoarchaeum equitans\nChlorobium chlorochromatii\nBurkholderia cenocepacia\nRhizobium leguminosarum\nEscherichia coli\nArchaeoglobus fulgidus\nMethanocaldococcus jannaschii\nPyrococcus abyssi\nOryza sativa nuclear\nOryza sativa mitochondrion\nOryza sativa chloroplast\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae nuclear\nHomo sapies nuclear\nDrosophila yakuba nuclear\nAmphidinium carterae nuclear\nThermotoga lettingae\nProchlorococcus marinus\nTrypanosoma cruzi\n\n\n\nNGPhylogeny.fr - A quick and easy working flow including multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic analysis and tree visualization\nThis web server is great place to learn the basic workflow for phylogenetic analysis and I use it on occasion when I just need a quick see of the relationships among a small set of sequences. Doing a phylogenetic analysis involves (1) assembling a group of sequences to evaluate, (2) aligning the sequences so that a distance can be calculate between the sequences, (3) determining the relationships among the sequences, and (4) visualizing the relationships. Step 1 was accomplished above by getting representative archaeal, bacterial and eukaryotic sequences from GenBank. Steps 2-4 will be done on web server that has been set up to run these steps at the same time. Go to the site Robust Phylogenetic Analysis For The Non-Specialist. Scroll down and under Phylogenetic Analysis select “One Click”. Upload or paste in your DNA sequences from the file in Moodle. Then click submit. This will start the analysis process. The numbers of the tree represent statistical support for the relationship. The more robust the relationship the closer the value will be to 1. The scale at the bottom represents sequence distance (e.g. 0.2 is 20%).\nThe newick tree file was added to the /work/pi_bio678_umass_edu/data/lab13/ directory"

Let’s load the libraries you’ll need if you haven’t already, and then import the tree using read.tree(). Displaying the object itself really isn’t useful. The output just tells you a little bit about the tree itself.\n\n\nR code\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggtree)\ntree &lt;- read.tree(\"data/lab13/tree_newick.nwk\")\ntree\n\n\nJust like with ggplot2 we created a basic canvas with ggplot(...) and added layers with +geom_???(), we can do the same here. The ggtree package gives us a geom_tree() function. Because ggtree is built on top of ggplot2, you get ggplot2’s default gray theme with white lines. You can override this with a theme from the ggtree package.\nBecause you’ll almost always want to add a tree geom and remove the default background and axes, the ggtree() function is essentially a shortcut for ggplot(...) + geom_tree() + theme_tree().\n\n\nR code\n# build a ggplot with a geom_tree\nggplot(tree) + geom_tree() + theme_tree()\n# This is convenient shorthand\nggtree(tree)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere’s also the treescale geom, which adds a scale bar, or alternatively, you can change the default ggtree() theme to theme_tree2(), which adds a scale on the x-axis. The horizontal dimension in this plot shows the amount of genetic change, and the branches and represent evolutionary lineages changing over time. The longer the branch in the horizonal dimension, the larger the amount of change, and the scale tells you this. The units of branch length are usually nucleotide substitutions per site – that is, the number of changes or substitutions divided by the length of the sequence (alternatively, it could represent the percent change, i.e., the number of changes per 100 bases).\n\n\nR code\n# add a scale\nggtree(tree) + geom_treescale()\n# or add the entire scale to the x axis with theme_tree2()\nggtree(tree) + theme_tree2()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default is to plot a phylogram, where the x-axis shows the genetic change / evolutionary distance. If you want to disable scaling and produce a cladogram instead, set the branch.length=\"none\" option inside the ggtree() call. See ?ggtree for more.\n\n\nR code\nggtree(tree, branch.length=\"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ... option in the help for ?ggtree represents additional options that are further passed to ggplot(). You can use this to change aesthetics of the plot. Let’s draw a cladogram (no branch scaling) using thick blue dotted lines (note that I’m not mapping these aesthetics to features of the data with aes() – we’ll get to that later).\n\n\nR code\nggtree(tree, branch.length=\"none\", color=\"blue\", size=2, linetype=3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1\nLook at the help again for ?ggtree, specifically at the layout= option. By default, it produces a rectangular layout.\n\nCreate a slanted phylogenetic tree.\nCreate a circular phylogenetic tree.\nCreate a circular unscaled cladogram with thick red lines.\n\n\n\n\nOther tree geoms\nLet’s add additional layers. We can create a plot object, e.g., p, to store the basic layout of a ggplot, and add more layers to it as we desire. Let’s add node and tip points.

Create a phylogeny with the following aesthetic characteristics:\n\ntips labeled in purple\npurple-colored diamond-shape tip points (hint: Google search “R point characters”)\nlarge semitransparent yellow node points (hint: alpha=)\nAdd a title with + ggtitle(...)"

    "text": "Tree annotation\nThe geom_tiplab() function adds some very rudimentary annotation. Let’s take annotation a bit further.\n\nInternal node number\nBefore we can go further we need to understand how ggtree is handling the tree structure internally. Some of the functions in ggtree for annotating clades need a parameter specifying the internal node number. To get the internal node number, user can use geom_text to display it, where the label is an aesthetic mapping to the “node variable” stored inside the tree object (think of this like the continent variable inside the gapminder object). We also supply the hjust option so that the labels aren’t sitting right on top of the nodes.\n\n\nR code\nggtree(tree) + geom_text(aes(label=node), hjust=-.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother way to get the internal node number is using MRCA() function by providing a vector of taxa names (created using c(\"taxon1\", \"taxon2\")).. The function will return node number of input taxa’s most recent commond ancestor (MRCA). First, re-create the plot so you can choose which taxa you want to grab the MRCA from.\n\n\nR code\nggtree(tree) + geom_tiplab()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s grab the most recent common ancestor for taxa C+E, and taxa G+H. We can use MRCA() to get the internal node numbers. Go back to the node-labeled plot from before to confirm this.\n\n\nR code\nMRCA(tree, c(\"C\", \"E\"))\n\n\n[1] 17\n\n\nR code\nMRCA(tree, c(\"G\", \"H\"))\n\n\n[1] 21\n\n\nR code\n# MRCA(tree, tip=c(\"C\", \"E\"))\n# MRCA(tree, tip=c(\"G\", \"H\"))\n\n\n\n\nLabeling clades\nWe can use geom_cladelabel() to add another geom layer to annotate a selected clade with a bar indicating the clade with a corresponding label. You select the clades using the internal node number for the node that connects all the taxa in that clade.\nLet’s annotate the clade with the most recent common ancestor between taxa C and E (internal node 17). Let’s make the annotation red. See ?geom_cladelabel help for more.\n\n\nR code\nggtree(tree) + \n  geom_cladelabel(node=17, label=\"Some random clade\", color=\"red\")\n\n\nLet’s add back in the tip labels. Notice how now the clade label is too close to the tip labels. Let’s add an offset to adjust the position. You might have to fiddle with this number to get it looking right.\n\n\nR code\nggtree(tree) + \n  geom_tiplab() + \n  geom_cladelabel(node=17, label=\"Some random clade\", \n                  color=\"red2\", offset=.8)\n\n\nNow let’s add another label for the clade connecting taxa G and H (internal node 21).\n\n\nR code\nggtree(tree) + \n  geom_tiplab() + \n  geom_cladelabel(node=17, label=\"Some random clade\", \n                  color=\"red2\", offset=.8) + \n  geom_cladelabel(node=21, label=\"A different clade\", \n                  color=\"blue\", offset=.8)\n\n\nUh oh. Now we have two problems. First, the labels would look better if they were aligned. That’s simple. Pass align=TRUE to geom_cladelabel() (see ?geom_cladelabel help for more). But now, the labels are falling off the edge of the plot. That’s because geom_cladelabel() is just adding it this layer onto the end of the existing canvas that was originally layed out in the ggtree call. This default layout tried to optimize by plotting the entire tree over the entire region of the plot. Here’s how we’ll fix this.\n\nFirst create the generic layout of the plot with ggtree(tree).\nAdd some tip labels.\nAdd each clade label.\nRemember theme_tree2()? We used it way back to add a scale to the x-axis showing the genetic distance. This is the unit of the x-axis. We need to set the limits on the x-axis. Google around for something like “ggplot2 x axis limits” and you’ll wind up on this StackOverflow page that tells you exactly how to solve it – just add on a + xlim(..., ...) layer. Here let’s extend out the axis a bit further to the right.\nFinally, if we want, we can either comment out the theme_tree2() segment of the code, or we could just add another theme layer on top of the plot altogether, which will override the theme that was set before. theme_tree() doesn’t have the scale.\n\n\n\nR code\nggtree(tree) + \n  geom_tiplab() + \n  geom_cladelabel(node=17, label=\"Some random clade\", \n                  color=\"red2\", offset=.8, align=TRUE) + \n  geom_cladelabel(node=21, label=\"A different clade\", \n                  color=\"blue\", offset=.8, align=TRUE) + \n  theme_tree2() + \n  xlim(0, 70) + \n  theme_tree()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we could highlight the entire clade with geom_hilight(). See the help for options to tweak.\n\n\nR code\nggtree(tree) + \n  geom_tiplab() + \n  geom_hilight(node=17, fill=\"gold\") + \n  geom_hilight(node=21, fill=\"purple\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnecting taxa\nSome evolutionary events (e.g. reassortment, horizontal gene transfer) can be visualized with some simple annotations on a tree. The geom_taxalink() layer draws straight or curved lines between any of two nodes in the tree, allow it to show evolutionary events by connecting taxa.\n\n\nR code\nggtree(tree) + \n  geom_tiplab() + \n  geom_taxalink(\"E\", \"H\", color=\"blue3\") +\n  geom_taxalink(\"C\", \"G\", color=\"orange2\", curvature=-.9)"

BEAST (Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Sampling Trees) can give you rooted, time-measured phylogenies inferred using molecular clock models.\nFor this you’ll need the flu_tree_beast.tree output file from BEAST and the flu_aasequence.fasta FASTA file with the multiple sequence alignment. These are both available on the data downloads page. First let’s read in the tree with read.beast() (instead of the read.tree() we used before). Let’s add a scale bar with theme_tree2(). This gives you genetic distance. But, we have time measured here with molecular clock models. We’ve only estimated the relative time between branching events, so if we want to actually see dates on the x-axis, we need to supply the most recent sampling date to the ggtree() call. Do this by setting mrsd=\"YYYY-MM-DD\" inside ggtree().\nFinally, let’s add some tip labels. We’ll want to right-align them, and by default the dotted line is a little too thick. Let’s reduce the linesize a bit. Now, some of the labels might be falling off the margin. Set the xlim to limit the axis to show between 1990 and 2020. You could get MRCAs and node numbers and do all the annotations that we did before the same way here.\n\n\nR code\n# Read the data\ntree &lt;- read.beast(\"data/lab13/flu_tree_beast.tree\")\n# supply a most recent sampling date so you get the dates\n# and add a scale bar\nggtree(tree, mrsd=\"2013-01-01\") + \n  theme_tree2() \n# Finally, add tip labels and adjust axis\nggtree(tree, mrsd=\"2013-01-01\") + \n  theme_tree2() + \n  geom_tiplab(align=TRUE, linesize=.5) + \n  xlim(1990, 2020)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, let’s look at ?msaplot. This puts the multiple sequence alignment and the tree side-by-side. The function takes a tree object (produced with ggtree()) and the path to the FASTA multiple sequence alignment. You can do it with the entire MSA, or you could restrict to just a window. Want something interesting-looking, but maybe not all that useful? Try changing the coordinate system of the plot itself by passing + coord_polar(theta=\"y\") to the end of the command!\n\n\nR code\nmsaplot(p=ggtree(tree), fasta=\"data/lab13/flu_aasequence.fasta\", window=c(150, 175))"

    "section": "Sequence Alignment Background",
    "text": "Sequence Alignment Background\nSequence Alignment is one of the most fundamental operations of bioinformatics. Sequence alignments are used to decide if genes or proteins are related functionally, structurally and evolutionarily. It is also at the core of sequence search methods such as BLAST.\nThere are three principal methods of pair-wise sequence alignment\n\nDot matrix analysis.\nThe dynamic programming (or DP) algorithm.\nWord or k-tuple methods (such as those used in BLAST and FASTA - which we will discuss later)\n\n\nDot matrix analysis\nThis method involves constructing a matrix with one of the sequences to be compared running horizontally across the bottom, and the other running vertically along the left-hand side. Each entry of the matrix is a measure of similarity of those two residues on the horizontal and vertical sequence. The simplest scoring system, distinguishes only between identical (dots) and non-identical (blank) residues.\nThe dot plot displays graphically any possible sequence alignments as diagonals on the matrix. Insertions, deletions, direct repeats and inverted repeats can be visually detected on a dot plot. Dot plot can also detect regions of RNA that are self-complementary and thus might form secondary structure.\n\nRef:\nThis dot plot represents an alignment of two different strains of Helicobacter pylori. Forward matches are shown in red, while reverse matches are shown in green. This alignment clearly shows a major inversion event centered around the origin of replication.UM\n\n\nThe dynamic programming algorithm\n“Dynamic programming was formalized by mathematician Richard Bellman, who was working at RNAD corporation on optimal decision processes. He wanted to concoct an impressive name that would shield his work from US Secretary of Defense Charles Wilson, a man know to be hostile to mathematics research. His work involved times series and planning - thus ‘dynamic’ and ‘programming’ (note, nothing particularly to do with computer programming). Bellman especially liked ‘dynamic’ because”it’s impossible to use the work dynamic in the pejorative sense”; he figured dynamic programming was “something not even a Congressman could object to” (Bellman 1984).” (Eddy 2004)\nThe dynamic programming algorithm is at the heart of many bioinformatics programs including BLAST (sequence searching), FASTA (sequence searching), CLUSTALW (multiple sequence alignmnet), HMMER (profile searching), GENSCAN (gene finding), MFOLD (RNA folding), and PHYLIP (phylogenetic analysis). Dynamic programing was first used for global alignment of protein sequences by Needleman and Wunnsch (1970) and to find local alignments by Smith and Waterson (1981).\n  MLIGKVIGSVVSTRKN-LNVGKFMIVEPLK\n  |     |  |  ||   || ||||     |        Global Alignment\n  MVAARLI-VWANTRKTSLNLGKFMLAEIIK\n  \n              TRKN-LNVGKFM\n              ||   || ||||               Local Alignment\n              TRKTDLNLGKFML\n\n\n\nSubsitution penalties differ for particular nucleotides or aminoacids\nAmino acids are put together into proteins based on their three nucleotide codons, and most mutational events usually only change one nucleotide at time. For example, starting with the Alanine codon GCU and looking at all possible changes on a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code#RNA_codon_table\nGCU -&gt; UCU = Alanine (A) -&gt; Serine (S)\nGCU -&gt; ACU = Alanine (A) -&gt; Threonine (T)\nGCU -&gt; CCU = Alanine (A) -&gt; Proline (P)\nGCU -&gt; GUU = Alanine (A) -&gt; Valine (V)\nGCU -&gt; GAU = Alanine (A) -&gt; Aspartic Acid (D)\nGCU -&gt; GGU = Alanine (A) -&gt; Glycine (G)\nGCU -&gt; GCA = Alanine (A) -&gt; Alanine (A)\nGCU -&gt; GCC = Alanine (A) -&gt; Alanine (A)\nGCU -&gt; GCG = Alanine (A) -&gt; Alanine (A)\nThus, from the Alanine codon GCU with a single substitution we can only get to 6 of the 19 other amino acids and 33% of the changes are going to result in keeping Alanine at the site in the protein, the other six amino acids would result 11% of the time. Even if we look at all codons for Alanine, there are still 12 amino acids that can not be made by single substitution. Thus, the frequency of changing Alanine to another amino acid by a single nucleotide change would be\n       A   R   N   D   C   Q   E   G   H   I   L   K   M   F   P   S   T   W   Y   V\n    A .33  0   0  .06  0   0  .06 .11  0   0   0   0   0   0  .11 .11 .11  0   0  .11\n\n\n\nOrigin of protein substitution matrices and bioinformatics\nProtein substitution matrices were first developed by Margaret Dayhoff, one of the founders of the field of bioinformatics. She was particularly interested in the possibility of deducing the evolutionary relationships of organisms from protein sequences. Toward these ends she collected all the known protein sequences and, as a service to the scientific community, made them available to others in 1965 in a small book, the first Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure.\nRef: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Oakley_Dayhoff\nFrom these sequences, she and her coworkers developed a model of protein evolution which resulted in the development of a set of widely used substitution matrices. These are frequently called Dayhoff or PAM (Percent Accepted Mutation) matrices and similar matrices are used in many areas of bioinformatics including: sequence similarity searches (e.g. BLAST), multiple sequence alignment tools (e.g ClustalW), phylogenetics and identifying functional regions of proteins.\n\n\nNatural selection governs which amino acid changes are observed\nJust like mutation mucks with the frequency matrix so does Natural Selection. Changes that occur between amino acids that have different biochemical properties are likely to affect the function of the protein. Therefore, a substitution is more likely to occur between amino acids with similar biochemical properties. In the above example with the Alanine codon a substitution that yields an amino acid change would result in mostly changes to other neutral amino acids, whereas the frequency of change to Aspartic Acid would probably be much lower. Amazingly, the genetic code has evolved to minimize changes between amino acids with different biochemical properties.\nAmino Acid          Side chain polarity Side chain acidity or basicity\n Alanine              nonpolar            neutral\n Arginine             polar                  strongly basic\n Asparagine           polar                  neutral\n Aspartic acid        polar                  acidic\n Cysteine             polar                  neutral\n Glutamic acid        polar                  acidic\n Glutamine            polar                  neutral\n Glycine              nonpolar               neutral\n Histidine            polar                  weakly basic\n Isoleucine           nonpolar               neutral\n Leucine              nonpolar               neutral\n Lysine               polar                  basic\n Methionine           nonpolar               neutral\n Phenylalanine        nonpolar               neutral\n Proline              nonpolar               neutral\n Serine               polar                  neutral\n Threonine            polar                  neutral\n Tryptophan           nonpolar               neutral\n Tyrosine             polar                  neutral\n Valine               nonpolar               neutral\n\n\n\nAccounting for multiple substitutions\nAs time goes on and sequence divergence gets larger it gets harder to account for multiple substitutions at the same amino acid position. PAM protein matrices are based on global alignments of closely related proteins. However, sequence changes over long evolutionary time scales are not well approximated by compounding small changes that occur over short time scales. For comparing more distantly related sequence other types of matrices are used. One of the most common is the The BLOSUM (BLOck SUbstitution Matrix) series of matrices created by Steve Henikoff and colleagues. Both the PAM and BLOSUM are not expressed as transformation frequencies but the probabilities of transformation are expressed by log-odds scores as shown below for a BLOSUM62 matrix.\n\nRef: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_matrix"

Ideally, one would know the phylogeny for the sequences; this would help infer the sequence of indels. Unfortunately one normally needs a multiple sequence alignment to make inferences about how the sequences are related. Most alignment algorithms make a quick approximation of phylogeny, and then base alignments on these. Sound circular? You are right and this is a challenging problem that is at the forefront of research in phylogenetics…the joint estimation of the alignment and phylogeny. For this class we will stick to the traditional method of first aligning sequences followed by phylogenetic analysis.\nProgressive alignment methods are efficient enough to implement on a large scale for many (100s to 1000s) sequences. Progressive alignment services are commonly available on publicly accessible web servers so users need not locally install the applications of interest. The most popular progressive alignment method has been the Clustal family Different portals or implementations can vary in user interface and make different parameters accessible to the user. Clustal Omega is used extensively for phylogenetic tree construction.\nThe basic steps in Clustal are:\n\nCalculate all possible pairwise alignments, record the score for each pair\nCalculate a guide tree based on the pairwise distances (algorithm: Neighbor Joining)\nFind the two most closely related sequences\nAlign these sequences (algorithm: Smith-Waterman).\n\nCalculate a consensus of this alignment\nReplace the two sequences with the consensus\nFind the two next-most closely related sequences (one of these could be a previously determined consensus sequence).\nIterate until all sequences have been aligned\n\nExpand the consensus sequences with the (gapped) original sequences\nReport the multiple sequence alignment\n\n\nSoftware for sequence alignment\nThere are many tools available for sequence alignment. The common tools are hosting at the European Bioinformatics Institute.\n\nPairwise sequence alignment\nMultiple sequence alignment\n\nThe most commonly used are Clustal, Muscle and MAFFT. MAFFT is commonly implemented for working with large data sets and where speed is important (e.g. web servers)"

In this project you will be given a DNA sequence, then construct a multiple sequence alignment and do a phylogenetic analysis to show the relationships among the taxa represented by the DNA sequences.\nFrom a practical perspective, phylogenetic analysis is broken up into methods related to tree building and tree visualization.

Doing a phylogenetic analysis involves (1) assembling a group of sequences to evaluate, (2) aligning the sequences so that a distance can be calculate between the sequences, (3) determining the relationships among the sequences, and (4) visualizing the relationships. Step 1 was accomplished above by getting representative archaeal, bacterial and eukaryotic sequences from GenBank. Steps 2-4 will be done on web server that has been set up to run these steps at the same time. Go to the site Robust Phylogenetic Analysis For The Non-Specialist. Scroll down and under Phylogenetic Analysis select “One Click”. Upload or paste in your DNA sequences from the file in Moodle. Then click submit. This will start the analysis process. The numbers of the tree represent statistical support for the relationship. The more robust the relationship the closer the value will be to 1.

    "text": "Basic trees\nLet’s first import our tree data. We’re going to work with a made-up phylogeny with 13 taxa tree_newick.nwk. Let’s load the libraries you’ll need if you haven’t already, and then import the tree using read.tree(). Displaying the object itself really isn’t useful. The output just tells you a little bit about the tree itself.\n\n\nR code\ntree &lt;- read.tree(\"data/lab13/tree_newick.nwk\")\ntree\n\n\nJust like with ggplot2 we created a basic canvas with ggplot(...) and added layers with +geom_???(), we can do the same here. The ggtree package gives us a geom_tree() function. Because ggtree is built on top of ggplot2, you get ggplot2’s default gray theme with white lines. You can override this with a theme from the ggtree package.\nBecause you’ll almost always want to add a tree geom and remove the default background and axes, the ggtree() function is essentially a shortcut for ggplot(...) + geom_tree() + theme_tree().\n\n\nR code\n# build a ggplot with a geom_tree\nggplot(tree) + geom_tree() + theme_tree()\n# This is convenient shorthand\nggtree(tree)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere’s also the treescale geom, which adds a scale bar, or alternatively, you can change the default ggtree() theme to theme_tree2(), which adds a scale on the x-axis. The horizontal dimension in this plot shows the amount of genetic change, and the branches and represent evolutionary lineages changing over time. The longer the branch in the horizonal dimension, the larger the amount of change, and the scale tells you this. The units of branch length are usually nucleotide substitutions per site – that is, the number of changes or substitutions divided by the length of the sequence (alternatively, it could represent the percent change, i.e., the number of changes per 100 bases).\n\n\nR code\n# add a scale\nggtree(tree) + geom_treescale()\n# or add the entire scale to the x axis with theme_tree2()\nggtree(tree) + theme_tree2()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default is to plot a phylogram, where the x-axis shows the genetic change / evolutionary distance. If you want to disable scaling and produce a cladogram instead, set the branch.length=\"none\" option inside the ggtree() call. See ?ggtree for more.\n\n\nR code\nggtree(tree, branch.length=\"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ... option in the help for ?ggtree represents additional options that are further passed to ggplot(). You can use this to change aesthetics of the plot. Let’s draw a cladogram (no branch scaling) using thick blue dotted lines (note that I’m not mapping these aesthetics to features of the data with aes() – we’ll get to that later).\n\n\nR code\nggtree(tree, branch.length=\"none\", color=\"blue\", size=2, linetype=3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1\nLook at the help again for ?ggtree, specifically at the layout= option. By default, it produces a rectangular layout.\n\nCreate a slanted phylogenetic tree.\nCreate a circular phylogenetic tree.\nCreate a circular unscaled cladogram with thick red lines.\n\n\n\n\nOther tree geoms\nLet’s add additional layers. We can create a plot object, e.g., p, to store the basic layout of a ggplot, and add more layers to it as we desire. Let’s add node and tip points. Let’s finally label the tips.\n\n\nR code\n# create the basic plot\np &lt;- ggtree(tree)\n# add node points\np + geom_nodepoint()\n# add tip points\np + geom_tippoint()\n# Label the tips\np + geom_tiplab()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2\nSimilar to how we change the aesthetics for the tree inside the ggtree() call, we can also change the aesthetics of the points themselves by passing graphical parameters inside the geom_nodepoint() or geom_tippoint() calls. Create a phylogeny with the following aesthetic characteristics:\n\ntips labeled in purple\npurple-colored diamond-shape tip points (hint: Google search “R point characters”)\nlarge semitransparent yellow node points (hint: alpha=)\nAdd a title with + ggtitle(...)"

    "section": "Tree annotation",
    "text": "Tree annotation\nThe geom_tiplab() function adds some very rudimentary annotation. Let’s take annotation a bit further.\n\nInternal node number\nBefore we can go further we need to understand how ggtree is handling the tree structure internally. Some of the functions in ggtree for annotating clades need a parameter specifying the internal node number. To get the internal node number, user can use geom_text to display it, where the label is an aesthetic mapping to the “node variable” stored inside the tree object (think of this like the continent variable inside the gapminder object). We also supply the hjust option so that the labels aren’t sitting right on top of the nodes.\n\n\nR code\nggtree(tree) + geom_text(aes(label=node), hjust=-.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother way to get the internal node number is using MRCA() function by providing a vector of taxa names (created using c(\"taxon1\", \"taxon2\")).. The function will return node number of input taxa’s most recent commond ancestor (MRCA). First, re-create the plot so you can choose which taxa you want to grab the MRCA from.\n\n\nR code\nggtree(tree) + geom_tiplab()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s grab the most recent common ancestor for taxa C+E, and taxa G+H. We can use MRCA() to get the internal node numbers. Go back to the node-labeled plot from before to confirm this.\n\n\nR code\nMRCA(tree, c(\"C\", \"E\"))\n\n\n[1] 17\n\n\nR code\nMRCA(tree, c(\"G\", \"H\"))\n\n\n[1] 21\n\n\nR code\n# MRCA(tree, tip=c(\"C\", \"E\"))\n# MRCA(tree, tip=c(\"G\", \"H\"))\n\n\n\n\nLabeling clades\nWe can use geom_cladelabel() to add another geom layer to annotate a selected clade with a bar indicating the clade with a corresponding label. You select the clades using the internal node number for the node that connects all the taxa in that clade.\nLet’s annotate the clade with the most recent common ancestor between taxa C and E (internal node 17). Let’s make the annotation red. See ?geom_cladelabel help for more.\n\n\nR code\nggtree(tree) + \n  geom_cladelabel(node=17, label=\"Some random clade\", color=\"red\")\n\n\nLet’s add back in the tip labels. Notice how now the clade label is too close to the tip labels. Let’s add an offset to adjust the position. You might have to fiddle with this number to get it looking right.\n\n\nR code\nggtree(tree) + \n  geom_tiplab() + \n  geom_cladelabel(node=17, label=\"Some random clade\", \n                  color=\"red2\", offset=.8)\n\n\nNow let’s add another label for the clade connecting taxa G and H (internal node 21).\n\n\nR code\nggtree(tree) + \n  geom_tiplab() + \n  geom_cladelabel(node=17, label=\"Some random clade\", \n                  color=\"red2\", offset=.8) + \n  geom_cladelabel(node=21, label=\"A different clade\", \n                  color=\"blue\", offset=.8)\n\n\nUh oh. Now we have two problems. First, the labels would look better if they were aligned. That’s simple. Pass align=TRUE to geom_cladelabel() (see ?geom_cladelabel help for more). But now, the labels are falling off the edge of the plot. That’s because geom_cladelabel() is just adding it this layer onto the end of the existing canvas that was originally layed out in the ggtree call. This default layout tried to optimize by plotting the entire tree over the entire region of the plot. Here’s how we’ll fix this.\n\nFirst create the generic layout of the plot with ggtree(tree).\nAdd some tip labels.\nAdd each clade label.\nRemember theme_tree2()? We used it way back to add a scale to the x-axis showing the genetic distance. This is the unit of the x-axis. We need to set the limits on the x-axis. Google around for something like “ggplot2 x axis limits” and you’ll wind up on this StackOverflow page that tells you exactly how to solve it – just add on a + xlim(..., ...) layer. Here let’s extend out the axis a bit further to the right.\nFinally, if we want, we can either comment out the theme_tree2() segment of the code, or we could just add another theme layer on top of the plot altogether, which will override the theme that was set before. theme_tree() doesn’t have the scale.\n\n\n\nR code\nggtree(tree) + \n  geom_tiplab() + \n  geom_cladelabel(node=17, label=\"Some random clade\", \n                  color=\"red2\", offset=.8, align=TRUE) + \n  geom_cladelabel(node=21, label=\"A different clade\", \n                  color=\"blue\", offset=.8, align=TRUE) + \n  theme_tree2() + \n  xlim(0, 70) + \n  theme_tree()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we could highlight the entire clade with geom_hilight(). See the help for options to tweak.\n\n\nR code\nggtree(tree) + \n  geom_tiplab() + \n  geom_hilight(node=17, fill=\"gold\") + \n  geom_hilight(node=21, fill=\"purple\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnecting taxa\nSome evolutionary events (e.g. reassortment, horizontal gene transfer) can be visualized with some simple annotations on a tree. The geom_taxalink() layer draws straight or curved lines between any of two nodes in the tree, allow it to show evolutionary events by connecting taxa.\n\n\nR code\nggtree(tree) + \n  geom_tiplab() + \n  geom_taxalink(\"E\", \"H\", color=\"blue3\") +\n  geom_taxalink(\"C\", \"G\", color=\"orange2\", curvature=-.9)"

The sequence data set was re-analyzed by using BEAST (available at http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/). BEAST (Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Sampling Trees) can give you rooted, time-measured phylogenies inferred using molecular clock models.\nFor this you’ll need the flu_tree_beast.tree output file from BEAST and the flu_aasequence.fasta FASTA file with the multiple sequence alignment. These are both available on the data downloads page. First let’s read in the tree with read.beast() (instead of the read.tree() we used before). Let’s add a scale bar with theme_tree2(). This gives you genetic distance. But, we have time measured here with molecular clock models. We’ve only estimated the relative time between branching events, so if we want to actually see dates on the x-axis, we need to supply the most recent sampling date to the ggtree() call. Do this by setting mrsd=\"YYYY-MM-DD\" inside ggtree().\nFinally, let’s add some tip labels. We’ll want to right-align them, and by default the dotted line is a little too thick. Let’s reduce the linesize a bit. Now, some of the labels might be falling off the margin. Set the xlim to limit the axis to show between 1990 and 2020. You could get MRCAs and node numbers and do all the annotations that we did before the same way here.\n\n\nR code\n# Read the data\ntree &lt;- read.beast(\"data/lab13/flu_tree_beast.tree\")\n# supply a most recent sampling date so you get the dates\n# and add a scale bar\nggtree(tree, mrsd=\"2013-01-01\") + \n  theme_tree2() \n# Finally, add tip labels and adjust axis\nggtree(tree, mrsd=\"2013-01-01\") + \n  theme_tree2() + \n  geom_tiplab(align=TRUE, linesize=.5) + \n  xlim(1990, 2020)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, let’s look at ?msaplot. This puts the multiple sequence alignment and the tree side-by-side. The function takes a tree object (produced with ggtree()) and the path to the FASTA multiple sequence alignment. You can do it with the entire MSA, or you could restrict to just a window. Want something interesting-looking, but maybe not all that useful? Try changing the coordinate system of the plot itself by passing + coord_polar(theta=\"y\") to the end of the command!\n\n\nR code\nmsaplot(p=ggtree(tree), fasta=\"data/lab13/flu_aasequence.fasta\", window=c(150, 175))"

You can override this with a theme from the ggtree package.\nBecause you’ll almost always want to add a tree geom and remove the default background and axes, the ggtree() function is essentially a shortcut for ggplot(...) + geom_tree() + theme_tree().\n\n\nR code\n# build a ggplot with a geom_tree\nggplot(tree) + geom_tree() + theme_tree()\n# This is convenient shorthand\nggtree(tree)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere’s also the treescale geom, which adds a scale bar, or alternatively, you can change the default ggtree() theme to theme_tree2(), which adds a scale on the x-axis. The horizontal dimension in this plot shows the amount of genetic change, and the branches and represent evolutionary lineages changing over time. The longer the branch in the horizonal dimension, the larger the amount of change, and the scale tells you this. The units of branch length are usually nucleotide substitutions per site – that is, the number of changes or substitutions divided by the length of the sequence (alternatively, it could represent the percent change, i.e., the number of changes per 100 bases).\n\n\nR code\n# add a scale\nggtree(tree) + geom_treescale()\n# or add the entire scale to the x axis with theme_tree2()\nggtree(tree) + theme_tree2()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default is to plot a phylogram, where the x-axis shows the genetic change / evolutionary distance. If you want to disable scaling and produce a cladogram instead, set the branch.length=\"none\" option inside the ggtree() call. See ?ggtree for more.\n\n\nR code\nggtree(tree, branch.length=\"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ... option in the help for ?ggtree represents additional options that are further passed to ggplot(). You can use this to change aesthetics of the plot. Let’s draw a cladogram (no branch scaling) using thick blue dotted lines (note that I’m not mapping these aesthetics to features of the data with aes() – we’ll get to that later).\n\n\nR code\nggtree(tree, branch.length=\"none\", color=\"blue\", size=2, linetype=3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1\nLook at the help again for ?ggtree, specifically at the layout= option. By default, it produces a rectangular layout.\n\nCreate a slanted phylogenetic tree.\nCreate a circular phylogenetic tree.\nCreate a circular unscaled cladogram with thick red lines.\n\n\n\n\nOther tree geoms\nLet’s add additional layers. We can create a plot object, e.g., p, to store the basic layout of a ggplot, and add more layers to it as we desire. Let’s add node and tip points. Let’s finally label the tips.\n\n\nR code\n# create the basic plot\np &lt;- ggtree(tree)\n# add node points\np + geom_nodepoint()\n# add tip points\np + geom_tippoint()\n# Label the tips\np + geom_tiplab()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2\nSimilar to how we change the aesthetics for the tree inside the ggtree() call, we can also change the aesthetics of the points themselves by passing graphical parameters inside the geom_nodepoint() or geom_tippoint() calls. Create a phylogeny with the following aesthetic characteristics:\n\ntips labeled in purple\npurple-colored diamond-shape tip points (hint: Google search “R point characters”)\nlarge semitransparent yellow node points (hint: alpha=)\nAdd a title with + ggtitle(...)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTree annotation\nThe geom_tiplab() function adds some very rudimentary annotation. Let’s take annotation a bit further.\n\nInternal node number\nBefore we can go further we need to understand how ggtree is handling the tree structure internally. Some of the functions in ggtree for annotating clades need a parameter specifying the internal node number. To get the internal node number, user can use geom_text to display it, where the label is an aesthetic mapping to the “node variable” stored inside the tree object (think of this like the continent variable inside the gapminder object). We also supply the hjust option so that the labels aren’t sitting right on top of the nodes.\n\n\nR code\nggtree(tree) + geom_text(aes(label=node), hjust=-.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother way to get the internal node number is using MRCA() function by providing a vector of taxa names (created using c(\"taxon1\", \"taxon2\")).. The function will return node number of input taxa’s most recent commond ancestor (MRCA). First, re-create the plot so you can choose which taxa you want to grab the MRCA from.\n\n\nR code\nggtree(tree) + geom_tiplab()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s grab the most recent common ancestor for taxa C+E, and taxa G+H. We can use MRCA() to get the internal node numbers. Go back to the node-labeled plot from before to confirm this.\n\n\nR code\nMRCA(tree, c(\"C\", \"E\"))\n\n\n[1] 17\n\n\nR code\nMRCA(tree, c(\"G\", \"H\"))\n\n\n[1] 21\n\n\nR code\n# MRCA(tree, tip=c(\"C\", \"E\"))\n# MRCA(tree, tip=c(\"G\", \"H\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nLabeling clades\nWe can use geom_cladelabel() to add another geom layer to annotate a selected clade with a bar indicating the clade with a corresponding label. You select the clades using the internal node number for the node that connects all the taxa in that clade.\nLet’s annotate the clade with the most recent common ancestor between taxa C and E (internal node 17). Let’s make the annotation red. See ?geom_cladelabel help for more.\n\n\nR code\nggtree(tree) + \n  geom_cladelabel(node=17, label=\"Some random clade\", color=\"red\")\n\n\nLet’s add back in the tip labels. Notice how now the clade label is too close to the tip labels. Let’s add an offset to adjust the position. You might have to fiddle with this number to get it looking right.\n\n\nR code\nggtree(tree) + \n  geom_tiplab() + \n  geom_cladelabel(node=17, label=\"Some random clade\", \n                  color=\"red2\", offset=.8)\n\n\nNow let’s add another label for the clade connecting taxa G and H (internal node 21).\n\n\nR code\nggtree(tree) + \n  geom_tiplab() + \n  geom_cladelabel(node=17, label=\"Some random clade\", \n                  color=\"red2\", offset=.8) + \n  geom_cladelabel(node=21, label=\"A different clade\", \n                  color=\"blue\", offset=.8)\n\n\nUh oh. Now we have two problems. First, the labels would look better if they were aligned. That’s simple. Pass align=TRUE to geom_cladelabel() (see ?geom_cladelabel help for more). But now, the labels are falling off the edge of the plot. That’s because geom_cladelabel() is just adding it this layer onto the end of the existing canvas that was originally layed out in the ggtree call. This default layout tried to optimize by plotting the entire tree over the entire region of the plot. Here’s how we’ll fix this.\n\nFirst create the generic layout of the plot with ggtree(tree).\nAdd some tip labels.\nAdd each clade label.\nRemember theme_tree2()? We used it way back to add a scale to the x-axis showing the genetic distance. This is the unit of the x-axis. We need to set the limits on the x-axis. Google around for something like “ggplot2 x axis limits” and you’ll wind up on this StackOverflow page that tells you exactly how to solve it – just add on a + xlim(..., ...) layer. Here let’s extend out the axis a bit further to the right.\nFinally, if we want, we can either comment out the theme_tree2() segment of the code, or we could just add another theme layer on top of the plot altogether, which will override the theme that was set before. theme_tree() doesn’t have the scale.\n\n\n\nR code\nggtree(tree) + \n  geom_tiplab() + \n  geom_cladelabel(node=17, label=\"Some random clade\", \n                  color=\"red2\", offset=.8, align=TRUE) + \n  geom_cladelabel(node=21, label=\"A different clade\", \n                  color=\"blue\", offset=.8, align=TRUE) + \n  theme_tree2() + \n  xlim(0, 70) + \n  theme_tree()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we could highlight the entire clade with geom_hilight(). See the help for options to tweak.\n\n\nR code\nggtree(tree) + \n  geom_tiplab() + \n  geom_hilight(node=17, fill=\"gold\") + \n  geom_hilight(node=21, fill=\"purple\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnecting taxa\nSome evolutionary events (e.g. reassortment, horizontal gene transfer) can be visualized with some simple annotations on a tree. The geom_taxalink() layer draws straight or curved lines between any of two nodes in the tree, allow it to show evolutionary events by connecting taxa.\n\n\nR code\nggtree(tree) + \n  geom_tiplab() + \n  geom_taxalink(\"E\", \"H\", color=\"blue3\") +\n  geom_taxalink(\"C\", \"G\", color=\"orange2\", curvature=-.9)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3\nProduce the figure below.\n\nFirst, find what the MRCA is for taxa B+C, and taxa L+J. You can do this in one of two ways:\n\nEasiest: use MRCA(tree, tip=c(\"taxon1\", \"taxon2\")) for B/C and L/J separately.\nAlternatively: use ggtree(tree) + geom_text(aes(label=node), hjust=-.3) to see what the node labels are on the plot. You might also add tip labels here too.\n\nDraw the tree with ggtree(tree).\nAdd tip labels.\nHighlight these clades with separate colors.\nAdd a clade label to the larger superclade (node=17) that we saw before that includes A, B, C, D, and E. You’ll probably need an offset to get this looking right.\nLink taxa C to E, and G to J with a dashed gray line (hint: get the geom working first, then try changing the aesthetics. You’ll need linetype=2 somewhere in the geom_taxalink()).\nAdd a scale bar to the bottom by changing the theme.\nAdd a title.\nOptionally, go back to the original ggtree(tree, ...) call and change the layout to \"circular\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced tree annotation\nLet’s use a previously published dataset from this paper:\nLiang et al. “Expansion of genotypic diversity and establishment of 2009 H1N1 pandemic-origin internal genes in pigs in China.” Journal of virology (2014): 88(18):10864-74.\nThis data was reanalyzed in the ggtree paper.\nThe subset of the data used here contains 76 H3 hemagglutinin gene sequences of a lineage containing both swine and human influenza A viruses. The sequence data set was re-analyzed by using BEAST (available at http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/). BEAST (Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Sampling Trees) can give you rooted, time-measured phylogenies inferred using molecular clock models.\nFor this you’ll need the flu_tree_beast.tree output file from BEAST and the flu_aasequence.fasta FASTA file with the multiple sequence alignment. These are both available on the data downloads page. First let’s read in the tree with read.beast() (instead of the read.tree() we used before). Let’s add a scale bar with theme_tree2(). This gives you genetic distance. But, we have time measured here with molecular clock models. We’ve only estimated the relative time between branching events, so if we want to actually see dates on the x-axis, we need to supply the most recent sampling date to the ggtree() call. Do this by setting mrsd=\"YYYY-MM-DD\" inside ggtree().\nFinally, let’s add some tip labels. We’ll want to right-align them, and by default the dotted line is a little too thick. Let’s reduce the linesize a bit. Now, some of the labels might be falling off the margin. Set the xlim to limit the axis to show between 1990 and 2020. You could get MRCAs and node numbers and do all the annotations that we did before the same way here.\n\n\nR code\n# Read the data\ntree &lt;- read.beast(\"data/lab9/flu_tree_beast.tree\")\n# tree &lt;- read.tree(\"/work/pi_bio678_umass_edu/data/lab9/flu_tree_beast.tree\")\n# supply a most recent sampling date so you get the dates\n# and add a scale bar\nggtree(tree, mrsd=\"2013-01-01\") + \n  theme_tree2() \n# Finally, add tip labels and adjust axis\nggtree(tree, mrsd=\"2013-01-01\") + \n  theme_tree2() + \n  geom_tiplab(align=TRUE, linesize=.5) + \n  xlim(1990, 2020)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, let’s look at ?msaplot. This puts the multiple sequence alignment and the tree side-by-side. The function takes a tree object (produced with ggtree()) and the path to the FASTA multiple sequence alignment. You can do it with the entire MSA, or you could restrict to just a window. Want something interesting-looking, but maybe not all that useful? Try changing the coordinate system of the plot itself by passing + coord_polar(theta=\"y\") to the end of the command!\n\n\nR code\n# msaplot(p=ggtree(tree), fasta=\"/work/pi_bio678_umass_edu/data/lab9/flu_aasequence.fasta\", window=c(150, 175))\n\nmsaplot(p=ggtree(tree), fasta=\"data/lab9/flu_aasequence.fasta\", window=c(150, 175))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBonus!\nSee the ggtree vignettes for more details on how these work.\n\n\nMany trees\nggtree will let you plot many trees at once, and you can facet them the normal ggplot2 way. Let’s generate 3 replicates each of 4 random trees with 10, 25, 50, and 100 tips, plotting them all.\n\n\nR code\nset.seed(42)\ntrees &lt;- lapply(rep(c(10, 25, 50, 100), 3), rtree)\nclass(trees) &lt;- \"multiPhylo\"\nggtree(trees) + facet_wrap(~.id, scale=\"free\", ncol=4) + ggtitle(\"Many trees. Such phylogenetics. Wow.\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotting trees with other data\nFor showing a phylogenetic tree alongside other panels with your own data, the facet_plot() function accepts a input data.frame and a geom function to draw the input data.\n\n\nR code\n# Generate a random tree with 30 tips\ntree &lt;- rtree(30)\n# Make the original plot\np &lt;- ggtree(tree)\n# generate some random values for each tip label in the data\nd1 &lt;- data.frame(id=tree$tip.label, val=rnorm(30, sd=3))\n# Make a second plot with the original, naming the new plot \"dot\", \n# using the data you just created, with a point geom.\np2 &lt;- facet_plot(p, panel=\"dot\", data=d1, geom=geom_point, aes(x=val), color='red3')\n# Make some more data with another random value.\nd2 &lt;- data.frame(id=tree$tip.label, value = abs(rnorm(30, mean=100, sd=50)))\n# Now add to that second plot, this time using the new d2 data above, \n# This time showing a bar segment, size 3, colored blue.\np3 &lt;- facet_plot(p2, panel='bar', data=d2, geom=geom_segment, \n           aes(x=0, xend=value, y=y, yend=y), size=3, color='blue4') \n# Show all three plots with a scale\np3 + theme_tree2()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverlay organism silouhettes\nphylopic.org hosts free silhouette images of animals, plants, and other life forms, all under Creative Commons or Public Domain. You can use ggtree to overlay a phylopic image on your plot at a node of your choosing.\n\n\nR code\n# get phylopic \n\nnewick &lt;- \"((Pongo_abelii,(Gorilla_gorilla_gorilla,(Pan_paniscus,Pan_troglodytes)Pan,Homo_sapiens)Homininae)Hominidae,Nomascus_leucogenys)Hominoidea;\"\n\ntree &lt;- read.tree(text=newick)\n\nd &lt;- ggimage::phylopic_uid(tree$tip.label)\nd$body_mass = c(52, 114, 47, 45, 58, 6)\n\np &lt;- ggtree(tree) %&lt;+% d + \n  geom_tiplab(aes(image=uid, colour=body_mass), geom=\"phylopic\", offset=2.5) +\n  geom_tiplab(aes(label=label), offset = .2) + xlim(NA, 7) +\n  scale_color_viridis_c()\np  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips\nIf you the tree is not fitting in the plot space you can modify the xlim\n\n\nR code\n# Add to your \nggtree(tree) +\n  xlim(0,2) # This worked from my rectangular trees\n  xlim(0.36) # This worked for my circular trees\n\n\nTo show the bootstrap values\n\n\nR code\nggtree(tree) +  \n  geom_nodelab()\n\n\nTo change text size and position\n\n\nR code\nggtree(tree) +\n  geom_tiplab(hjust=-.1, size = 3)\n\n\nTo change the size of the highlighted clade you can use extend\n\n\nR code\nggtree(tree) +\n  geom_hilight(node=9, fill=\"gold\", extend = 0.5) \n\n\nYou can order the layers when highlighting for certain effects"

These jobs are submitted to a job scheduler, which manages resources and executes them when the required resources (such as CPUs, memory, etc.) become available. Unity uses Slurm (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management), a popular open-source job scheduler used in many supercomputing clusters and high-performance computing (HPC) setups.\nsbatch is a command within Slurm that is used to submit batch jobs. sbatch is a non-blocking command, meaning there is no circumstance where running the command will cause it to hold. If the resources requested in the batch job are unavailable, the job will be placed into a queue and will start to run once resources become available.\nHere are the steps\nOpen a new file using nano or in JupyterLab Select File &gt; New &gt; Text File\nnano sbatch_addition.sh\n\nCreate a Job Script\nA job script is a Bash script with SLURM directives at the top.

This is done in the terminal using chmod (for more info see https://cets.seas.upenn.edu/answers/chmod.html).\nchmod +x sbatch_addition.sh\n\n\nSubmit the Job\nUse sbatch to submit the job:\nsbatch sbatch_addition.sh\nSLURM will return a job ID, e.g.:\nSubmitted batch job 123456\nWhen the job is complete you will see a new file in your directory with your ID slurm-123456.txt\nWe could also include in our addition.R file code to print to a file\n\n\nMonitor the Job\nCheck job status:\nsqueue -u $USER\nCancel a job:\nscancel &lt;job_id&gt;\n\n\nCommon SLURM Directives\n\n\n\nDirective\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n--job-name\nName of the job\n\n\n--output / --error\nOutput and error file names\n\n\n--time\nMax runtime\n\n\n--partition\nWhich queue/partition to use\n\n\n--ntasks\nNumber of tasks (often 1 for serial jobs)\n\n\n--cpus-per-task\nNumber of CPU cores per task\n\n\n--mem\nMemory per node"

    "text": "Additional examples for accessing data\nHere are some other examples to help you get started with NEON metagenomic data\n\nMerging pH measurements\nThe example above showing how to merge data works for many straightforward measurements, for which calculating the mean is logical. For pH measures, however, this won’t work. Since pH is a logarithmic scale, averaging them will not work. Fortunately, the R package respirometry includes the function mean_pH for averaging pH measurements. This function first converts each pH measure to hydrogen ion concentration [H+], averages the measures, then converts back to the logarithmic scale.\nBelow we show an example with the existing data. First we will create a new table with pH measurements, only keeping the samples from our metagenomic set:\n\n\nR code\nsoilpH_Example &lt;- soilChem$sls_soilpH %&gt;%\n  dplyr::filter(sampleID %in% combinedTab$sampleID) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(sampleID,soilInWaterpH,soilInCaClpH)\n\n# now join with the existing table\ncombinedTab_pH &lt;- left_join(combinedTab,soilpH_Example, by = \"sampleID\")\n\n# and the final\nhead(combinedTab_pH)\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  sampleID              genomicsSampleID soilMoisture soilInWaterpH soilInCaClpH\n  &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;chr&gt;                   &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 HARV_034-O-23-202307… HARV_034-O-2023…         3.41          3.45         2.7 \n2 HARV_034-O-41-202307… HARV_034-O-2023…         2.98          3.28         2.6 \n3 HARV_034-O-39-202307… HARV_034-O-2023…         2.70          3.34         2.71\n4 HARV_033-O-39-202307… HARV_033-O-2023…         3.48          3.85         3.04\n5 HARV_033-O-21-202307… HARV_033-O-2023…         2.76          3.99         3.29\n6 HARV_033-O-41-202307… HARV_033-O-2023…         3.31          3.63         2.84\n\n\nNow, we can apply the same kind of tidyverse approach as the previous example, only using the mean_pH function:\n\n\nR code\nlibrary(respirometry)\n\ngenome_groups_pH &lt;- combinedTab_pH %&gt;%\n  group_by(genomicsSampleID) %&gt;%\n  summarize_at(c(\"soilInWaterpH\",\"soilInCaClpH\"), mean_pH) \n\nhead(genome_groups_pH)\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  genomicsSampleID         soilInWaterpH soilInCaClpH\n  &lt;chr&gt;                            &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 BONA_001-O-20230710-COMP          3.99         3.45\n2 BONA_002-O-20230711-COMP          4.35         3.82\n3 BONA_004-O-20230712-COMP          3.69         3.10\n4 BONA_006-O-20230710-COMP          4.05         3.48\n5 BONA_009-O-20230711-COMP          4.08         3.50\n6 BONA_013-O-20230710-COMP          3.97         3.42\n\n\nOne thing to note with the previous command is that all the other chemical data was lost when you ran the command. In this example we use two summarize_at commands to apply different functions to the two types of variables, and then left_join will combine them:\n\n\nR code\ngenome_groups_all &lt;- combinedTab_pH %&gt;%\n  group_by(genomicsSampleID) %&gt;%\n  {left_join(\n    summarize_at(.,vars(\"soilMoisture\"), mean),\n    summarize_at(.,vars(\"soilInWaterpH\",\"soilInCaClpH\"), mean_pH)\n  )}\nhead(genome_groups_all)\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  genomicsSampleID         soilMoisture soilInWaterpH soilInCaClpH\n  &lt;chr&gt;                           &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 BONA_001-O-20230710-COMP         1.55          3.99         3.45\n2 BONA_002-O-20230711-COMP         1.14          4.35         3.82\n3 BONA_004-O-20230712-COMP         3.55          3.69         3.10\n4 BONA_006-O-20230710-COMP         2.54          4.05         3.48\n5 BONA_009-O-20230711-COMP         1.93          4.08         3.50\n6 BONA_013-O-20230710-COMP         2.45          3.97         3.42"

    "section": "Why Store Multiple Data Frames in a Single Object in R?",
    "text": "Why Store Multiple Data Frames in a Single Object in R?\nWhen working with R, it’s common to handle multiple datasets—whether they represent different time periods, experimental conditions, or subsets of a larger dataset. Instead of scattering these data frames across your environment, storing them in a single object offers several practical advantages. Here’s why this approach is considered a best practice.\n\n1. Better Organization and Readability\nManaging numerous standalone data frames can quickly become messy. By grouping them into a single object—typically a list or a named list—you create a structured container that keeps related data together. This makes your workspace cleaner and your code easier to read.\n\n\n2. Simplifies Iterative Operations\nLists allow you to apply functions across all data frames without repetitive code. Functions like lapply(), purrr::map(), or dplyr pipelines make it easy to automate transformations, summaries, and visualizations.\n\n\n3. Dynamic Handling of Data\nIf you’re importing multiple files or working with an unknown number of datasets, storing them in a single object enables programmatic handling. You can loop through files, read them into data frames, and store them in a list without hardcoding names.\n\n\n4. Facilitates Automation and Reproducibility\nA single object can be saved using saveRDS() or save(), ensuring all related data frames are preserved together. This makes sharing and reproducing analyses straightforward.\n\n\n5. Supports Complex Workflows\nLists can hold not only data frames but also metadata, models, and other objects. This flexibility is useful for hierarchical data structures or multi-step analyses where related components need to stay grouped.\n\n\n6. Reduces Risk of Errors\nWhen data frames are stored in a single object, you avoid naming conflicts and accidental overwriting. It also makes it easier to track which datasets belong to a project."

    "section": "Understanding RDS Files in R",
    "text": "Understanding RDS Files in R\nRDS files are a specific format used in R for saving single R objects. This format is beneficial for preserving the structure and attributes of the data, making it ideal for data serialization, the process of translating a data structure or object state into a format that can be stored or transmitted and reconstructed later.\n\nSaving R Objects as RDS Files\nTo save an R object as an RDS file, you can use the saveRDS() function. Here’s how it works:\n\nSyntax:\n\nsaveRDS(object, file = \"filename.rds\")\n\nExample:\n\nsaveRDS(mtcars, \"mtcars.rds\")\nThis command saves the mtcars dataset into a file named mtcars.rds.\n\n\nReading RDS Files\nTo read an RDS file back into R, use the readRDS() function:\n\nSyntax:\n\nobject &lt;- readRDS(file = \"filename.rds\")\n\nExample:\n\nmy_data &lt;- readRDS(\"mtcars.rds\")\nThis command restores the mtcars dataset from the RDS file into the variable my_data. We will use a RDS file to save the NEON data\n\n\nKey Features of RDS File\n\nSingle Object Storage: RDS files are designed to store a single R object, unlike other formats that can store multiple objects.\nCompression: RDS files can be compressed, which helps save disk space.\nPreservation of Structure: When saving data in RDS format, the data structure (like data frames, lists, etc.) and attributes are preserved.\n\n\n\nComparison with Other Formats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nRDS Files\nCSV Files\n\n\n\n\nStores\nSingle R object\nTabular data\n\n\nStructure Preservation\nYes\nNo\n\n\nCompression\nYes\nNo\n\n\nRead/Write Functions\nsaveRDS(), readRDS()\nwrite.csv(), read.csv()\n\n\n\nUsing RDS files is a great way to save and load R objects efficiently while maintaining their integrity."

You can click on the tabs to see the columns in each data frame.\n\n\nWrangling sample data for metagenomic samples\nNow that you are familiar with downloading and viewing the soilChem data, we can start to focus on linking the data to the metagenomic samples. For soil samples, the DNA samples for metagenomics are combined from up to 3 individual soil samples. This is why you will not see any of the chemistry data we just viewed corresponding to any metagenomic DNA sample directly. We need to access the list of samples that were combined to create a soil composite sample, so we can link these data directly. For this we look at the sls_metagenomicsPooling table.\nIn this table soilChem$sls_metagenomicsPooling the list for each composite DNA sample is in the column genomicsPooledIDList. For example, if we want to look at the list of samples used for the composite sample ‘HARV_013-O-20230704-COMP’ (sample is in the genomicsSampleID field), we can pull up the list for the 11th sample in the table:\n\n\nR code\nsoilChem$sls_metagenomicsPooling[5,'genomicsSampleID']\n\n\n[1] \"HARV_013-O-20230704-COMP\"\n\n\nR code\nsoilChem$sls_metagenomicsPooling[5,'collectDate']\n\n\n[1] \"2023-07-04 19:03:00 UTC\"\n\n\nR code\nsoilChem$sls_metagenomicsPooling$genomicsPooledIDList[5]\n\n\n[1] \"HARV_013-O-39-20230704|HARV_013-O-41-20230704|HARV_013-O-23-20230704\"\n\n\nFrom the list you can see that there are three samples for the composite sample (there can be anywhere from 1-3 samples for each composite), all from plot HARV_013 collected on 7/04/2023, and all from the organic soil horizon (O). Now we can observe the chemical measurements for those specific samples. We will use tidyverse to help get the fields from the table. Let’s take the first one as an example:\n\n\nR code\n# View(soilChem$sls_soilChemistry # No soil chemistry data for HARV\nsoilChem$sls_soilMoisture |&gt; \n  filter(sampleID == \"HARV_013-O-39-20230704\") |&gt; \n  select(sampleID, soilMoisture)\n\n\nWe would like to be able to get these measurements for all the metagenomic subsamples. For this, we will first have to get the list for each composite sample and create a new table.\n\n\nR code\n# split up the pooled list into new columns\ngenomicSamples &lt;- soilChem$sls_metagenomicsPooling |&gt;\n  tidyr::separate(genomicsPooledIDList, into=c(\"first\",\"second\",\"third\"),sep=\"\\\\|\",fill=\"right\") |&gt;\n  dplyr::select(genomicsSampleID,first,second,third)\n\nhead(genomicSamples)\n\n\n          genomicsSampleID                  first                 second\n1 HARV_034-O-20230703-COMP HARV_034-O-23-20230703 HARV_034-O-41-20230703\n2 HARV_033-O-20230703-COMP HARV_033-O-39-20230703 HARV_033-O-21-20230703\n3 HARV_035-O-20230704-COMP HARV_035-O-23-20230704 HARV_035-O-41-20230704\n4 HARV_037-O-20230704-COMP HARV_037-O-41-20230704 HARV_037-O-21-20230704\n5 HARV_013-O-20230704-COMP HARV_013-O-39-20230704 HARV_013-O-41-20230704\n6 HARV_001-O-20230705-COMP HARV_001-O-41-20230705 HARV_001-O-21-20230705\n                   third\n1 HARV_034-O-39-20230703\n2 HARV_033-O-41-20230703\n3 HARV_035-O-21-20230704\n4 HARV_037-O-23-20230704\n5 HARV_013-O-23-20230704\n6 HARV_001-O-23-20230705\n\n\nNow we will adjust the table so that each sampleID is a row, with the genomicsSampleID listed for each sample:\n\n\nR code\ngenSampleExample &lt;- genomicSamples |&gt; \n  tidyr::pivot_longer(cols=c(\"first\",\"second\",\"third\"),values_to = \"sampleID\") |&gt;\n  dplyr::select(sampleID,genomicsSampleID) |&gt;\n  drop_na()\n\n\nNow that you have all samples for each metagenomic sample listed, you can easily combine this table with other tables, using the sampleID. As an example we will go back to the soil chemistry data:\n\n\nR code\nchemEx &lt;- soilChem$sls_soilMoisture |&gt;\n  dplyr::select(sampleID,soilMoisture)\n\n## now combine the tables \ncombinedTab &lt;- left_join(genSampleExample,chemEx, by = \"sampleID\") |&gt; drop_na()\n\n## Show the data table\nhead(combinedTab)\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  sampleID               genomicsSampleID         soilMoisture\n  &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;chr&gt;                           &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 HARV_034-O-23-20230703 HARV_034-O-20230703-COMP         3.41\n2 HARV_034-O-41-20230703 HARV_034-O-20230703-COMP         2.98\n3 HARV_034-O-39-20230703 HARV_034-O-20230703-COMP         2.70\n4 HARV_033-O-39-20230703 HARV_033-O-20230703-COMP         3.48\n5 HARV_033-O-21-20230703 HARV_033-O-20230703-COMP         2.76\n6 HARV_033-O-41-20230703 HARV_033-O-20230703-COMP         3.31\n\n\n\n\nMerging metadata around composite samples\nWe now have a table that includes the genetic subsamples and their corresponding biogeochemical measurements. However, if we want to compare the biogeochemical data directly with the metagenomic genomic samples, you may want to merge the rows in the table back to a single row for each composite sample. This means we will need to average the chemical measurements across the subsamples for each composite sample. Care must be taken, however, when averaging across certain measurements (see in particular the example for averaging pH, below). Here is a basic example for our table:\n\n\nR code\ngenome_groups_mean &lt;- combinedTab %&gt;%\n  group_by(genomicsSampleID) %&gt;%\n  summarize_at(c(\"soilMoisture\"), mean)\n\nhead(genome_groups_mean)\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  genomicsSampleID         soilMoisture\n  &lt;chr&gt;                           &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 BONA_001-O-20230710-COMP         1.55\n2 BONA_002-O-20230711-COMP         1.14\n3 BONA_004-O-20230712-COMP         3.55\n4 BONA_006-O-20230710-COMP         2.54\n5 BONA_009-O-20230711-COMP         1.93\n6 BONA_013-O-20230710-COMP         2.45"

    "text": "Additional examples for accessing data\nHere are some other examples to help you get started with NEON metagenomic data\n\nMerging pH measurements\nThe example above showing how to merge data works for many straightforward measurements, for which calculating the mean is logical. For pH measures, however, this won’t work. Since pH is a logarithmic scale, averaging them will not work. Fortunately, the R package respirometry includes the function mean_pH for averaging pH measurements. This function first converts each pH measure to hydrogen ion concentration [H+], averages the measures, then converts back to the logarithmic scale.\nBelow we show an example with the existing data. First we will create a new table with pH measurements, only keeping the samples from our metagenomic set:\n\n\nR code\nsoilpH_Example &lt;- soilChem$sls_soilpH %&gt;%\n  dplyr::filter(sampleID %in% combinedTab$sampleID) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(sampleID,soilInWaterpH,soilInCaClpH)\n\n# now join with the existing table\ncombinedTab_pH &lt;- left_join(combinedTab,soilpH_Example, by = \"sampleID\")\n\n# and the final\nhead(combinedTab_pH)\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  sampleID              genomicsSampleID soilMoisture soilInWaterpH soilInCaClpH\n  &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;chr&gt;                   &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 HARV_034-O-23-202307… HARV_034-O-2023…         3.41          3.45         2.7 \n2 HARV_034-O-41-202307… HARV_034-O-2023…         2.98          3.28         2.6 \n3 HARV_034-O-39-202307… HARV_034-O-2023…         2.70          3.34         2.71\n4 HARV_033-O-39-202307… HARV_033-O-2023…         3.48          3.85         3.04\n5 HARV_033-O-21-202307… HARV_033-O-2023…         2.76          3.99         3.29\n6 HARV_033-O-41-202307… HARV_033-O-2023…         3.31          3.63         2.84\n\n\nNow, we can apply the same kind of tidyverse approach as the previous example, only using the mean_pH function:\n\n\nR code\n# Remember to install the respirometry package\nlibrary(respirometry)\n\ngenome_groups_pH &lt;- combinedTab_pH %&gt;%\n  group_by(genomicsSampleID) %&gt;%\n  summarize_at(c(\"soilInWaterpH\",\"soilInCaClpH\"), mean_pH) \n\nhead(genome_groups_pH)\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  genomicsSampleID         soilInWaterpH soilInCaClpH\n  &lt;chr&gt;                            &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 BONA_001-O-20230710-COMP          3.99         3.45\n2 BONA_002-O-20230711-COMP          4.35         3.82\n3 BONA_004-O-20230712-COMP          3.69         3.10\n4 BONA_006-O-20230710-COMP          4.05         3.48\n5 BONA_009-O-20230711-COMP          4.08         3.50\n6 BONA_013-O-20230710-COMP          3.97         3.42\n\n\nOne thing to note with the previous command is that all the other chemical data was lost when you ran the command. In this example we use two summarize_at commands to apply different functions to the two types of variables, and then left_join will combine them:\n\n\nR code\ngenome_groups_all_mean &lt;- combinedTab_pH %&gt;%\n  group_by(genomicsSampleID) %&gt;%\n  {left_join(\n    summarize_at(.,vars(\"soilMoisture\"), mean),\n    summarize_at(.,vars(\"soilInWaterpH\",\"soilInCaClpH\"), mean_pH)\n  )}\n\nhead(genome_groups_all_mean)\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  genomicsSampleID         soilMoisture soilInWaterpH soilInCaClpH\n  &lt;chr&gt;                           &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 BONA_001-O-20230710-COMP         1.55          3.99         3.45\n2 BONA_002-O-20230711-COMP         1.14          4.35         3.82\n3 BONA_004-O-20230712-COMP         3.55          3.69         3.10\n4 BONA_006-O-20230710-COMP         2.54          4.05         3.48\n5 BONA_009-O-20230711-COMP         1.93          4.08         3.50\n6 BONA_013-O-20230710-COMP         2.45          3.97         3.42"

    "text": "RDS Files\nRDS files are a specific format used in R for saving single R objects. This format is beneficial for preserving the structure and attributes of the data, making it ideal for data serialization, the process of translating a data structure or object state into a format that can be stored or transmitted and reconstructed later.\n\nSaving R Objects as RDS Files\nTo save an R object as an RDS file, you can use the saveRDS() function. Here’s how it works:\n\nSyntax:\n\nsaveRDS(object, file = \"filename.rds\")\n\nExample:\n\nsaveRDS(mtcars, \"mtcars.rds\")\nThis command saves the mtcars dataset into a file named mtcars.rds.\n\n\nReading RDS Files\nTo read an RDS file back into R, use the readRDS() function:\n\nSyntax:\n\nobject &lt;- readRDS(file = \"filename.rds\")\n\nExample:\n\nmy_data &lt;- readRDS(\"mtcars.rds\")\nThis command restores the mtcars dataset from the RDS file into the variable my_data. We will use a RDS file to save the NEON data\n\n\nKey Features of RDS File\n\nSingle Object Storage: RDS files are designed to store a single R object, unlike other formats that can store multiple objects.\nCompression: RDS files can be compressed, which helps save disk space.\nPreservation of Structure: When saving data in RDS format, the data structure (like data frames, lists, etc.) and attributes are preserved.\n\n\n\nComparison with Other Formats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nRDS Files\nCSV Files\n\n\n\n\nStores\nSingle R object\nTabular data\n\n\nStructure Preservation\nYes\nNo\n\n\nCompression\nYes\nNo\n\n\nRead/Write Functions\nsaveRDS(), readRDS()\nwrite.csv(), read.csv()\n\n\n\nUsing RDS files is a great way to save and load R objects efficiently while maintaining their integrity."

    "text": "Exercises\nToday we will build on the self-motivated analysis of the NEON MAGs and their associated metadata (including the soil chemistry data). As with last week upload your NEON_soilMAGs_soilChem.csv file into co-pilot. Then ask for suggestions in the types of analysis you can do. This week pick a different category than last week. Some possibilies are\n\nCommunity Composition & Diversity\n\n\nTaxonomic profiling: Summarize relative abundances of phyla, classes, or genera across sites.\nAlpha diversity: Compute metrics like Shannon, Simpson, and richness for each site.\nBeta diversity: Compare community composition between sites using Bray-Curtis or UniFrac distances.\nOrdination: Perform PCA, NMDS, or PCoA to visualize differences in microbial communities.\n\n\nEnvironmental Correlations\n\n\nSoil chemistry vs. taxonomy: Correlate pH, moisture, temperature, and elevation with microbial diversity or specific taxa.\nGradient analysis: Identify taxa enriched along environmental gradients (e.g., moisture or pH).\nCanonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA): Link community composition to environmental variables.\n\n\nBiogeography & Spatial Patterns\n\n\nMapping taxa distributions: Visualize where specific taxa or functional groups occur across latitude/longitude.\nSpatial autocorrelation: Test if microbial communities are structured by geography.\nDistance-decay analysis: Examine how community similarity decreases with geographic distance.\n\n\nCo-occurrence & Network Analysis\n\n\nMicrobial interaction networks: Build co-occurrence networks to identify potential ecological interactions.\nModule detection: Identify clusters of taxa that respond similarly to environmental factors.\n\nAsk co-pilot for guidance and code in doing your analysis. As with last week this is an open ended lab. The expectations are that you spend class time exploring one of these areas and submit a lab report with your code."
