The Quabbin Reservoir is the primary water supply for Boston, 40 towns in the Greater Boston area and several surrounding towns. There is a rich history of the river valley. The name Quabbin, meaning meeting of many waters, is after Native American chief Nani-Quaben. Artifacts show that people (ancestors of the Nipmucs) were living in the Swift River Valley as far back as 12,000 years - Ref. Here is a timeline of events including the removal of the towns of Dana, Prescott, Enfield and Greenwich. Today the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) manages the forests surrounding the watershed which provide a living green bio-filter. The watershed “catches the rain, stores it, and releases it slowly, soaking up nutrients, keeping erosion to a minimum, and yielding a consistent supply of clean water.”\n\n\n\nNEON Harvard Forest and Quabbin sites\n\n\n\n\nNEON Data Portals\n\nNEON Soils\nNEON Soil Microbes\nNEON Aquatic Microbes\nNEON Pathogens\nNEON Biorepository"
