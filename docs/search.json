Through collaborations with the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) and the National Microbime Collaborative Network (NMDC), most of the metagenomic sequencing data are available on the data portals of these organizations. Connections to these external data sources are being built into NEON data releases.

This includes legacy data as well as all samples that are part of the JGI CSP award, which covers deep sequencing and analysis by JGI of all NEON metagenome samples collected in 2023 and 2024. Included in the table are several fields with JGI metadata and statistics for each sample, such as Sequencing Method, GenomeSize, GeneCount, and number of bins (metaBATbinCount). Also included are some NEON variables such as siteID and collectDate, as well as multiple environmental terms assigned to each sample according to ENVO specifications (e.g. Ecosystem Category, Ecosystem Type, Specific Ecosystem). The table also has reference codes for the Genome Online Database (GOLD), including GOLD Analysis Project ID and GOLD Study ID; and the taxon OID (imgGenomeID) that allows accessing the sample on the

In addition to the CDC One Health, the One Health perspective is supported by the One Health Commission (OHC), One Health Initiative, One Health Platform, CDC One Health Office, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH, founded as OIE), and the World Health Organization (WHO) – One Health Joint Plan of Action, 2022–2026. “One Health issues include emerging, re-emerging, and endemic zoonotic diseases, neglected tropical diseases, vector-borne diseases, antimicrobial resistance, food safety and food security, environmental contamination, climate change and other health threats shared by people, animals, and the environment.” - Center for Disease Control (CDC) One Health\n\n\n\nOne Health - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Health\n\n\n\n\n\nOur environmental data will come from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) funded through the National Science Foundation.

The Quabbin Reservoir is the primary water supply for Boston, 40 towns in the Greater Boston area and several surrounding towns. There is a rich history of the river valley. The name Quabbin, meaning meeting of many waters, is after Native American chief Nani-Quaben. Artifacts show that people (ancestors of the Nipmucs) were living in the Swift River Valley as far back as 12,000 years - Ref. Here is a timeline of events including the removal of the towns of Dana, Prescott, Enfield and Greenwich. Today the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) manages the forests surrounding the watershed which provide a living green bio-filter. The watershed “catches the rain, stores it, and releases it slowly, soaking up nutrients, keeping erosion to a minimum, and yielding a consistent supply of clean water.”\n\n\n\nNEON Harvard Forest and Quabbin sites\n\n\nHere are some of the NEON data portals we may work with\n\nNEON Soils\nNEON Soil Microbes\nNEON Aquatic Microbes\nNEON Pathogens\nNEON Biorepository\n\n\n\n\nOur metagenomic data comes from a collaboration between NEON and the Joint Genome Institute at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and supported by the US Department of Energy.
