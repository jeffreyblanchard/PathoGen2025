NEON’s mission is to “To collect and freely share critical ecological data, samples, and infrastructure with researchers and the public to advance understanding of ecological processes and inform the sustainable management of U.S. ecosystems.” NEON’s data are an important part of the One Health framework.\n\n\n\nNEON Field Sites - https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/about-field-sites\n\n\n\n\nNEON Harvard Forest and Quabbin Watershed sites\nThe NEON Harvard Forest and Quabbin Watershed sites are of particular interest to us in Massachusetts. The Quabbin Reservoir is the primary water supply for Boston, 40 towns in the Greater Boston area and several surrounding towns. There is a rich history of the river valley. The name Quabbin, meaning meeting of many waters, is after Native American chief Nani-Quaben. Artifacts show that people (ancestors of the Nipmucs) were living in the Swift River Valley as far back as 12,000 years - Ref. Here is a timeline of events including the removal of the towns of Dana, Prescott, Enfield and Greenwich. Today the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) manages the forests surrounding the watershed which provide a living green bio-filter. The watershed “catches the rain, stores it, and releases it slowly, soaking up nutrients, keeping erosion to a minimum, and yielding a consistent supply of clean water.”\n\n\n\nNEON Harvard Forest and Quabbin sites\n\n\n\n\nNEON Data Portals\n\nNEON Soils\nNEON Soil Microbes\nNEON Aquatic Microbes\nNEON Pathogens\nNEON Biorepository"
